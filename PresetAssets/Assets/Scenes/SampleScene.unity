    I\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD BECAME AN OUTLAW\r\n\r\n     List and hearken, gentlemen,\r\n    
    That be of free-born blood,\r\n     I shall you tell of a good yeoman,\r\n    
    His name was Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n     Robin was a proud outlaw,\r\n     While
    as he walked on the ground.\r\n     So courteous an outlaw as he was one\r\n    
    Was never none else found.\r\n\r\nIn the days of good King Harry the Second of
    England--he of the warring\r\nsons--there were certain forests in the north country
    set aside for the\r\nKing\u2019s hunting, and no man might shoot deer therein
    under penalty of\r\ndeath. These forests were guarded by the King\u2019s Foresters,
    the chief\r\nof whom, in each wood, was no mean man but equal in authority to
    the\r\nSheriff in his walled town, or even to my lord Bishop in his abbey.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the greatest of royal preserves was Sherwood and Barnesdale\r\nforests near
    the two towns of Nottingham and Barnesdale. Here for some\r\nyears dwelt one
    Hugh Fitzooth as Head Forester, with his good wife and\r\nson Robert. The boy
    had been born in Lockesley town--in the year 1160,\r\nstern records say--and
    was often called Lockesley, or Rob of Lockesley.\r\nHe was a comely, well-knit
    stripling, and as soon as he was strong\r\nenough to walk his chief delight was
    to go with his father into the\r\nforest. As soon as his right arm received thew
    and sinew he learned to\r\ndraw the long bow and speed a true arrow. While on
    winter evenings his\r\ngreatest joy was to hear his father tell of bold Will
    o\u2019 the Green, the\r\noutlaw, who for many summers defied the King\u2019s
    Foresters and feasted\r\nwith his men upon King\u2019s deer. And on other stormy
    days the boy learned\r\nto whittle out a straight shaft for the long bow, and
    tip it with gray\r\ngoose feathers.\r\n\r\nThe fond mother sighed when she saw
    the boy\u2019s face light up at these\r\nwoodland tales. She was of gentle birth,
    and had hoped to see her son\r\nfamous at court or abbey. She taught him to read
    and to write, to doff\r\nhis cap without awkwardness and to answer directly and
    truthfully both\r\nlord and peasant. But the boy, although he took kindly to
    these lessons\r\nof breeding, was yet happiest when he had his beloved bow in
    hand and\r\nstrolled at will, listening to the murmur of the trees.\r\n\r\nTwo
    playmates had Rob in these gladsome early days. One was Will\r\nGamewell, his
    father\u2019s brother\u2019s son, who lived at Gamewell Lodge, hard\r\nby Nottingham
    town. The other was Marian Fitzwalter, only child of the\r\nEarl of Huntingdon.
    The castle of Huntingdon could be seen from the top\r\nof one of the tall trees
    in Sherwood; and on more than one bright day\r\nRob\u2019s white signal from
    this tree told Marian that he awaited her there:\r\nfor you must know that Rob
    did not visit her at the castle. His father\r\nand her father were enemies. Some
    people whispered that Hugh Fitzooth\r\nwas the rightful Earl of Huntingdon, but
    that he had been defrauded out\r\nof his lands by Fitzwalter, who had won the
    King\u2019s favor by a crusade to\r\nthe Holy Land. But little cared Rob or Marian
    for this enmity, however\r\nit had arisen. They knew that the great green--wood
    was open to them,\r\nand that the wide, wide world was full of the scent of flowers
    and the\r\nsong of birds.\r\n\r\nDays of youth speed all too swiftly, and troubled
    skies come all too\r\nsoon. Rob\u2019s father had two other enemies besides Fitzwalter,
    in\r\nthe persons of the lean Sheriff of Nottingham and the fat Bishop of\r\nHereford.
    These three enemies one day got possession of the King\u2019s ear\r\nand whispered
    therein to such good--or evil--purpose that Hugh Fitzooth\r\nwas removed from
    his post of King\u2019s Forester. He and his wife and Rob,\r\nthen a youth of
    nineteen, were descended upon, during a cold winter\u2019s\r\nevening, and dispossessed
    without warning. The Sheriff arrested the\r\nForester for treason--of which,
    poor man, he was as guiltless as you or\r\nI--and carried him to Nottingham jail.
    Rob and his mother were sheltered\r\nover night in the jail, also, but next morning
    were roughly bade to go\r\nabout their business. Thereupon they turned for succor
    to their only\r\nkinsman, Squire George of Gamewell, who sheltered them in all
    kindness.\r\n\r\nBut the shock, and the winter night\u2019s journey, proved too
    much for\r\nDame Fitzooth. She had not been strong for some time before leaving
    the\r\nforest. In less than two months she was no more. Rob felt as though his\r\nheart
    was broken at this loss. But scarcely had the first spring flowers\r\nbegun to
    blossom upon her grave, when he met another crushing blow in\r\nthe loss of his
    father. That stern man had died in prison before his\r\naccusers could agree
    upon the charges by which he was to be brought to\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nTwo years
    passed by. Rob\u2019s cousin Will was away at school; and Marian\u2019s\r\nfather,
    who had learned of her friendship with Rob, had sent his\r\ndaughter to the court
    of Queen Eleanor. So these years were lonely ones\r\nto the orphaned lad. The
    bluff old Squire was kind to him, but secretly\r\ncould make nothing of one who
    went about brooding and as though seeking\r\nfor something he had lost. The truth
    is that Rob missed his old life\r\nin the forest no less than his mother\u2019s
    gentleness, and his father\u2019s\r\ncompanionship. Every time he twanged the
    string of the long bow against\r\nhis shoulder and heard the gray goose shaft
    sing, it told him of happy\r\ndays that he could not recall.\r\n\r\nOne morning
    as Rob came in to breakfast, his uncle greeted him with, \u201CI\r\nhave news
    for you, Rob, my lad!\u201D and the hearty old Squire finished his\r\ndraught
    of ale and set his pewter tankard down with a crash.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat may that
    be, Uncle Gamewell?\u201D asked the young man.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere is a chance
    to exercise your good long bow and win a pretty prize.\r\nThe Fair is on at Nottingham,
    and the Sheriff proclaims an archer\u2019s\r\ntournament. The best fellows are
    to have places with the King\u2019s\r\nForesters, and the one who shoots straightest
    of all will win for prize\r\na golden arrow--a useless bauble enough, but just
    the thing for your lady\r\nlove, eh, Rob my boy?\u201D Here the Squire laughed
    and whacked the table\r\nagain with his tankard.\r\n\r\nRob\u2019s eyes sparkled.
    \u201C\u2018Twere indeed worth shooting for, uncle mine,\u201D he\r\nsaid. \u201CI
    should dearly love to let arrow fly alongside another man. And\r\na place among
    the Foresters is what I have long desired. Will you let me\r\ntry?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo
    be sure,\u201D rejoined his uncle. \u201CWell I know that your good mother\r\nwould
    have had me make a clerk of you; but well I see that the greenwood\r\nis where
    you will pass your days. So, here\u2019s luck to you in the bout!\u201D\r\n And
    the huge tankard came a third time into play.\r\n\r\nThe young man thanked his
    uncle for his good wishes, and set about\r\nmaking preparations for the journey.
    He traveled lightly; but his yew\r\nbow must needs have a new string, and his
    cloth-yard arrows must be of\r\nthe straightest and soundest.\r\n\r\nOne fine
    morning, a few days after, Rob might have been seen passing\r\nby way of Lockesley
    through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham town. Briskly\r\nwalked he and gaily, for
    his hopes were high and never an enemy had he\r\nin the wide world. But \u2018twas
    the very last morning in all his life\r\nwhen he was to lack an enemy! For, as
    he went his way through Sherwood,\r\nwhistling a blithe tune, he came suddenly
    upon a group of Foresters,\r\nmaking merry beneath the spreading branches of
    an oak-tree. They had a\r\nhuge meat pie before them and were washing down prodigious
    slices of it\r\nwith nut brown ale.\r\n\r\nOne glance at the leader and Rob knew
    at once that he had found\r\nan enemy. \u2018Twas the man who had usurped his
    father\u2019s place as Head\r\nForester, and who had roughly turned his mother
    out in the snow. But\r\nnever a word said he for good or bad, and would have
    passed on his way,\r\nhad not this man, clearing his throat with a huge gulp,
    bellowed out:\r\n\u201CBy my troth, here is a pretty little archer! Where go
    you, my lad, with\r\nthat tupenny bow and toy arrows? Belike he would shoot at
    Nottingham\r\nFair! Ho! Ho!\u201D\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter greeted this sally.
    Rob flushed, for he was mightily\r\nproud of his shooting.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy bow
    is as good as yours,\u201D he retorted, \u201Cand my shafts will carry as\r\nstraight
    and as far. So I\u2019ll not take lessons of any of ye.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey laughed
    again loudly at this, and the leader said with frown:\r\n\r\n\u201CShow us some
    of your skill, and if you can hit the mark here\u2019s twenty\r\nsilver pennies
    for you. But if you hit it not you are in for a sound\r\ndrubbing for your pertness.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPick
    your own target,\u201D quoth Rob in a fine rage. \u201CI\u2019ll lay my head\r\nagainst
    that purse that I can hit it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt shall be as you say,\u201D
    retorted the Forester angrily, \u201Cyour head for\r\nyour sauciness that you
    hit not my target.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow at a little rise in the wood a herd of deer
    came grazing by, distant\r\nfull fivescore yards. They were King\u2019s deer,
    but at that distance seemed\r\nsafe from any harm. The Head Forester pointed
    to them.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your young arm could speed a shaft for half that distance,
    I\u2019d shoot\r\nwith you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDone!\u201D cried Rob. \u201CMy
    head against twenty pennies I\u2019ll cause yon fine\r\nfellow in the lead of
    them to breathe his last.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd without more ado he tried the string
    of his long bow, placed a shaft\r\nthereon, and drew it to his ear. A moment,
    and the quivering string sang\r\ndeath as the shaft whistled across the glade.
    Another moment and the\r\nleader of the herd leaped high in his tracks and fell
    prone, dyeing the\r\nsward with his heart\u2019s blood.\r\n\r\nA murmur of amazement
    swept through the Foresters, and then a growl of\r\nrage. He that had wagered
    was angriest of all.\r\n\r\n\u201CKnow you what you have done, rash youth?\u201D
    he said. \u201CYou have killed a\r\nKing\u2019s deer, and by the laws of King
    Harry your head remains forfeit.\r\nTalk not to me of pennies but get ye gone
    straight, and let me not look\r\nupon your face again.\u201D\r\n\r\nRob\u2019s
    blood boiled within him, and he uttered a rash speech. \u201CI have\r\nlooked
    upon your face once too often already, my fine Forester. \u2018Tis you\r\nwho
    wear my father\u2019s shoes.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with this he turned upon his heel
    and strode away.\r\n\r\nThe Forester heard his parting thrust with an oath. Red
    with rage he\r\nseized his bow, strung an arrow, and without warning launched
    it full\r\naf\u2019 Rob. Well was it for the latter that the Forester\u2019s
    foot turned on a\r\ntwig at the critical instant, for as it was the arrow whizzed
    by his ear\r\nso close as to take a stray strand of his hair with it. Rob turned
    upon\r\nhis assailant, now twoscore yards away.\r\n\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D said he.
    \u201CYou shoot not so straight as I, for all your bravado.\r\nTake this from
    the tupenny bow!\u201D\r\n\r\nStraight flew his answering shaft. The Head Forester
    gave one cry, then\r\nfell face downward and lay still. His life had avenged
    Rob\u2019s father, but\r\nthe son was outlawed. Forward he ran through the forest,
    before the\r\nband could gather their scattered wits--still forward into the
    great\r\ngreenwood. The swaying trees seemed to open their arms to the wanderer,\r\nand
    to welcome him home.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the same day, Rob paused hungry
    and weary at the\r\ncottage of a poor widow who dwelt upon the outskirts of the
    forest. Now\r\nthis widow had often greeted him kindly in his boyhood days, giving
    him\r\nto eat and drink. So he boldly entered her door. The old dame was right\r\nglad
    to see him, and baked him cakes in the ashes, and had him rest and\r\ntell her
    his story. Then she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis an evil wind that
    blows through Sherwood,\u201D she said. \u201CThe poor are\r\ndespoiled and the
    rich ride over their bodies. My three sons have been\r\noutlawed for shooting
    King\u2019s deer to keep us from starving, and now hide\r\nin the wood. And they
    tell me that twoscore of as good men as ever drew\r\nbow are in hiding with them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere
    are they, good mother?\u201D cried Rob. \u201CBy my faith, I will join\r\nthem.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    nay,\u201D replied the old woman at first. But when she saw that there\r\nwas
    no other way, she said: \u201CMy sons will visit me to-night. Stay you\r\nhere
    and see them if you must.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Rob stayed willingly to see the widow\u2019s
    sons that night, for they\r\nwere men after his own heart. And when they found
    that his mood was with\r\nthem, they made him swear an oath of fealty, and told
    him the haunt of\r\nthe band--a place he knew right well. Finally one of them
    said:\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the band lacks a leader--one who can use his head as well
    as\r\nhis hand. So we have agreed that he who has skill enough to go to\r\nNottingham,
    an outlaw, and win the prize at archery, shall be our\r\nchief.\u201D\r\n\r\nRob
    sprang to his feet. \u201CSaid in good time!\u201D cried he, \u201Cfor I had\r\nstarted
    to that self-same Fair, and all the Foresters, and all the\r\nSheriff\u2019s
    men in Christendom shall not stand between me and the center\r\nof their target!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    though he was but barely grown he stood so straight and his eye\r\nflashed with
    such fire that the three brothers seized his hand and\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    Lockesley! a Lockesley! if you win the golden arrow you shall be\r\nchief of
    outlaws in Sherwood Forest!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Rob fell to planning how he could
    disguise himself to go to\r\nNottingham town; for he knew that the Foresters
    had even then set a\r\nprice on his head in the market-place.\r\n\r\nIt was even
    as Rob had surmised. The Sheriff of Nottingham posted a\r\nreward of two hundred
    pounds for the capture, dead or alive, of one\r\nRobert Fitzooth, outlaw. And
    the crowds thronging the streets upon that\r\nbusy Fair day often paused to read
    the notice and talk together about\r\nthe death of the Head Forester.\r\n\r\nBut
    what with wrestling bouts and bouts with quarter-staves, and\r\nwandering minstrels,
    there came up so many other things to talk about,\r\nthat the reward was forgotten
    for the nonce, and only the Foresters\r\nand Sheriff\u2019s men watched the gates
    with diligence, the Sheriff indeed\r\nspurring them to effort by offers of largess.
    His hatred of the father\r\nhad descended to the son.\r\n\r\nThe great event
    of the day came in the afternoon. It was the archer\u2019s\r\ncontest for the
    golden arrow, and twenty men stepped forth to shoot.\r\nAmong them was a beggar-man,
    a sorry looking fellow with leggings of\r\ndifferent colors, and brown scratched
    face and hands. Over a tawny shock\r\nof hair he had a hood drawn, much like
    that of a monk. Slowly he limped\r\nto his place in the line, while the mob shouted
    in derision. But the\r\ncontest was open to all comers, so no man said him nay.\r\n\r\nSide
    by side with Rob--for it was he--stood a muscular fellow of swarthy\r\nvisage
    and with one eye hid by a green bandage. Him also the crowd\r\njeered, but he
    passed them by with indifference while he tried his bow\r\nwith practiced hand.\r\n\r\nA
    great crowd had assembled in the amphitheater enclosing the lists. All\r\nthe
    gentry and populace of the surrounding country were gathered there\r\nin eager
    expectancy. The central box contained the lean but pompous\r\nSheriff, his bejeweled
    wife, and their daughter, a supercilious young\r\nwoman enough, who, it was openly
    hinted, was hoping to receive the\r\ngolden arrow from the victor and thus be
    crowned queen of the day.\r\n\r\nNext to the Sheriff\u2019s box was one occupied
    by the fat Bishop of\r\nHereford; while in the other side was a box wherein sat
    a girl whose\r\ndark hair, dark eyes, and fair features caused Rob\u2019s heart
    to leap.\r\n\u2018Twas Maid Marian! She had come up for a visit from the Queen\u2019s
    court at\r\nLondon town, and now sat demurely by her father the Earl of Huntingdon.\r\nIf
    Rob had been grimly resolved to win the arrow before, the sight of\r\nher sweet
    face multiplied his determination an hundredfold. He felt his\r\nmuscles tightening
    into bands of steel, tense and true. Yet withal his\r\nheart would throb, making
    him quake in a most unaccountable way.\r\n\r\nThen the trumpet sounded, and the
    crowd became silent while the herald\r\nannounced the terms of the contest. The
    lists were open to all comers.\r\nThe first target was to be placed at thirty
    ells distance, and all those\r\nwho hit its center were allowed to shoot at the
    second target, placed\r\nten ells farther off. The third target was to be removed
    yet farther,\r\nuntil the winner was proved. The winner was to receive the golden
    arrow,\r\nand a place with the King\u2019s Foresters. He it was also who crowned
    the\r\nqueen of the day.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet sounded again, and the archers prepared
    to shoot. Rob looked\r\nto his string, while the crowd smiled and whispered at
    the odd figure\r\nhe cut, with his vari-colored legs and little cape. But as
    the first man\r\nshot, they grew silent.\r\n\r\nThe target was not so far but
    that twelve out of the twenty contestants\r\nreached its inner circle. Rob shot
    sixth in the line and landed fairly,\r\nbeing rewarded by an approving grunt
    from the man with the green\r\nblinder, who shot seventh, and with apparent carelessness,
    yet true to\r\nthe bull\u2019s-eye.\r\n\r\nThe mob cheered and yelled themselves
    hoarse at this even marksmanship.\r\nThe trumpet sounded again, and a new target
    was set up at forty ells.\r\n\r\nThe first three archers again struck true, amid
    the loud applause of the\r\nonlookers; for they were general favorites and expected
    to win. Indeed\r\n\u2018twas whispered that each was backed by one of the three
    dignitaries\r\nof the day. The fourth and fifth archers barely grazed the center.
    Rob\r\nfitted his arrow quietly and with some confidence sped it unerringly\r\ntoward
    the shining circle.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe beggar! the beggar!\u201D yelled the crowd;
    \u201Canother bull for the\r\nbeggar!\u201D In truth his shaft was nearer the
    center than any of the\r\nothers. But it was not so near that \u201CBlinder,\u201D
    as the mob had promptly\r\nchristened his neighbor, did not place his shaft just
    within the mark.\r\nAgain the crowd cheered wildly. Such shooting as this was
    not seen every\r\nday in Nottingham town.\r\n\r\nThe other archers in this round
    were disconcerted by the preceding\r\nshots, or unable to keep the pace. They
    missed one after another and\r\ndropped moodily back, while the trumpet sounded
    for the third round, and\r\nthe target was set up fifty ells distant.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    my halidom you draw a good bow, young master,\u201D said Rob\u2019s queer\r\ncomrade
    to him in the interval allowed for rest. \u201CDo you wish me to\r\nshoot first
    on this trial?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D said Rob, \u201Cbut you are a good
    fellow by this token, and if I win\r\nnot, I hope you may keep the prize from
    yon strutters.\u201D And he nodded\r\nscornfully to the three other archers who
    were surrounded by their\r\nadmirers, and were being made much of by retainers
    of the Sheriff, the\r\nBishop, and the Earl. From them his eye wandered toward
    Maid Marian\u2019s\r\nbooth. She had been watching him, it seemed, for their
    eyes met; then\r\nhers were hastily averted.\r\n\r\n\u201CBlinder\u2019s\u201D
    quick eye followed those of Rob. \u201CA fair maid, that,\u201D he\r\nsaid smilingly,
    \u201Cand one more worthy the golden arrow than the Sheriff\u2019s\r\nhaughty
    miss.\u201D\r\n\r\nRob looked at him swiftly, and saw naught but kindliness in
    his glance.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are a shrewd fellow and I like you well,\u201D was
    his only comment.\r\n\r\nNow the archers prepared to shoot again, each with some
    little care. The\r\ntarget seemed hardly larger than the inner ring had looked,
    at the first\r\ntrial. The first three sped their shafts, and while they were
    fair shots\r\nthey did not more than graze the inner circle.\r\n\r\nRob took
    his stand with some misgiving. Some flecking clouds overhead\r\nmade the light
    uncertain, and a handful of wind frolicked across the\r\nrange in a way quite
    disturbing to a bowman\u2019s nerves. His eyes wandered\r\nfor a brief moment
    to the box wherein sat the dark-eyed girl. His heart\r\nleaped! she met his glance
    and smiled at him reassuringly. And in that\r\nmoment he felt that she knew him
    despite his disguise and looked to him\r\nto keep the honor of old Sherwood.
    He drew his bow firmly and, taking\r\nadvantage of a momentary lull in the breeze,
    launched the arrow straight\r\nand true-singing across the range to the center
    of the target.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe beggar! the beggar! a bull! a bull!\u201D yelled
    the fickle mob,\r\nwho from jeering him were now his warm friends. \u201CCan
    you beat that,\r\nBlinder?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe last archer smiled scornfully and
    made ready. He drew his bow with\r\nease and grace and, without seeming to study
    the course, released the\r\nwinged arrow. Forward it leaped toward the target,
    and all eyes followed\r\nits flight. A loud uproar broke forth when it alighted,
    just without the\r\ncenter and grazing the shaft sent by Rob. The stranger made
    a gesture\r\nof surprise when his own eyes announced the result to him, but saw
    his\r\nerror. He had not allowed for the fickle gust of wind which seized the\r\narrow
    and carried it to one side. But for all that he was the first to\r\ncongratulate
    the victor.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope we may shoot again,\u201D quoth he. \u201CIn
    truth I care not for the\r\ngolden bauble and wished to win it in despite of
    the Sheriff for whom I\r\nhave no love. Now crown the lady of your choice.\u201D
    And turning suddenly\r\nhe was lost in the crowd, before Rob could utter what
    it was upon his\r\nlips to say, that he would shoot again with him.\r\n\r\nAnd
    now the herald summoned Rob to the Sheriff\u2019s box to receive the\r\nprize.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    are a curious fellow enough,\u201D said the Sheriff, biting his lip\r\ncoldly;
    \u201Cyet you shoot well. What name go you by?\u201D\r\n\r\nMarian sat near and
    was listening intently.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am called Rob the Stroller, my Lord Sheriff,\u201D
    said the archer.\r\n\r\nMarian leaned back and smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Rob
    the Stroller, with a little attention to your skin and\r\nclothes you would not
    be so bad a man,\u201D said the Sheriff. \u201CHow like you\r\nthe idea of entering
    my service.\r\n\r\n\u201CRob the Stroller has ever been a free man, my Lord,
    and desires no\r\nservice.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff\u2019s brow darkened, yet
    for the sake of his daughter and the\r\ngolden arrow, he dissembled.\r\n\r\n\u201CRob
    the Stroller,\u201D said he, \u201Chere is the golden arrow which has been\r\noffered
    to the best of archers this day. You are awarded the prize. See\r\nthat you bestow
    it worthily.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this point the herald nudged Rob and half inclined
    his head toward\r\nthe Sheriff\u2019s daughter, who sat with a thin smile upon
    her lips. But Rob\r\nheeded him not. He took the arrow and strode to the next
    box where sat\r\nMaid Marian.\r\n\r\n\u201CLady,\u201D he said, \u201Cpray accept
    this little pledge from a poor stroller\r\nwho would devote the best shafts in
    his quiver to serve you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy thanks to you, Rob in the Hood,\u201D
    replied she with a roguish twinkle\r\nin her eye; and she placed the gleaming
    arrow in her hair, while the\r\npeople shouted, \u201CThe Queen! the Queen!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff glowered furiously upon this ragged archer who had refused\r\nhis service,
    taken his prize without a word of thanks, and snubbed his\r\ndaughter. He would
    have spoken, but his proud daughter restrained him.\r\nHe called to his guard
    and bade them watch the beggar. But Rob had\r\nalready turned swiftly, lost himself
    in the throng, and headed straight\r\nfor the town gate.\r\n\r\nThat same evening
    within a forest glade a group of men--some twoscore\r\nclad in Lincoln green--sat
    round a fire roasting venison and making\r\nmerry. Suddenly a twig crackled and
    they sprang to their feet and seized\r\ntheir weapons.\r\n\r\n\u201CI look for
    the widow\u2019s sons,\u201D a clear voice said, \u201Cand I come alone.\u201D\r\n\r\nInstantly
    the three men stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CTis Rob!\u201D they cried; \u201Cwelcome
    to Sherwood Forest, Rob!\u201D And all the\r\nmen came and greeted him; for they
    had heard his story.\r\n\r\nThen one of the widow\u2019s sons, Stout Will, stepped
    forth and said:\r\n\r\n\u201CComrades all, ye know that our band has sadly lacked
    a leader--one of\r\nbirth, breeding, and skill. Belike we have found that leader
    in this\r\nyoung man. And I and my brothers have told him that the band would\r\nchoose
    that one who should bring the Sheriff to shame this day and\r\ncapture his golden
    arrow. Is it not so?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe band gave assent.\r\n\r\nWill turned to
    Rob. \u201CWhat news bring you from Nottingham town?\u201D asked\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nRob
    laughed. \u201CIn truth I brought the Sheriff to shame for mine own\r\npleasure,
    and won his golden arrow to boot. But as to the prize ye must\r\ne\u2019en take
    my word, for I bestowed it upon a maid.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd seeing the men stood
    in doubt at this, he continued: \u201CBut I\u2019ll\r\ngladly join your band,
    and you take me, as a common archer. For there\r\nare others older and mayhap
    more skilled than I.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen stepped one forward from the rest, a tall
    swarthy man. And Rob\r\nrecognized him as the man with the green blinder; only
    this was now\r\nremoved, and his freed eye gleamed as stoutly as the other one.\r\n\r\n\u201CRob
    in the Hood--for such the lady called you,\u201D said he, \u201CI can vouch\r\nfor
    your tale. You shamed the Sheriff e\u2019en as I had hoped to do; and we\r\ncan
    forego the golden arrow since it is in such fair hands. As to your\r\nshooting
    and mine, we must let future days decide. But here I, Will\r\nStutely, declare
    that I will serve none other chief save only you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen good Will
    Stutely told the outlaws of Rob\u2019s deeds, and gave him his\r\nhand of fealty.
    And the widow\u2019s sons did likewise, and the other members\r\nevery one, right
    gladly; because Will Stutely had heretofore been the\r\ntruest bow in all the
    company. And they toasted him in nut brown ale,\r\nand hailed him as their leader,
    by the name of Robin Hood. And he\r\naccepted that name because Maid Marian had
    said it.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the camp-fire the band exchanged signs and passwords.\r\nThey
    gave Robin Hood a horn upon which he was to blow to summon them.\r\nThey swore,
    also, that while they might take money and goods from the\r\nunjust rich, they
    would aid and befriend the poor and the helpless; and\r\nthat they would harm
    no woman, be she maid, wife, or widow. They swore\r\nall this with solemn oaths,
    while they feasted about the ruddy blaze,\r\nunder the greenwood tree.\r\n\r\nAnd
    that is how Robin Hood became an outlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHOW
    ROBIN HOOD MET LITTLE JOHN\r\n\r\n     \u201CO here is my hand,\u201D the stranger
    reply\u2019d,\r\n     \u201CI\u2019ll serve you with all my whole heart.\r\n    
    My name is John Little, a man of good mettle,\r\n     Ne\u2019er doubt me for
    I\u2019ll play my part.\u201D\r\n\r\n     \u201CHis name shall be altered,\u201D
    quoth William Stutely,\r\n     \u201CAnd I will his godfather be:\r\n     Prepare
    then a feast, and none of the least,\r\n     For we will be merry,\u201D quoth
    he.\r\n\r\nAll that summer Robin Hood and his merry men roamed in Sherwood Forest,\r\nand
    the fame of their deeds ran abroad in the land. The Sheriff of\r\nNottingham
    waxed wroth at the report, but all his traps and excursions\r\nfailed to catch
    the outlaws. The poor people began by fearing them, but\r\nwhen they found that
    the men in Lincoln green who answered Robin Hood\u2019s\r\nhorn meant them no
    harm, but despoiled the oppressor to relieve the\r\noppressed, they \u2018gan
    to have great liking for them. And the band\r\nincreased by other stout hearts
    till by the end of the summer fourscore\r\ngood men and true had sworn fealty.\r\n\r\nBut
    the days of quiet which came on grew irksome to Robin\u2019s adventurous\r\nspirit.
    Up rose he, one gay morn, and slung his quiver over his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis
    fresh breeze stirs the blood, my lads,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand I would\r\nbe
    seeing what the gay world looks like in the direction of Nottingham\r\ntown.
    But tarry ye behind in the borders of the forest, within earshot\r\nof my bugle
    call.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus saying he strode merrily forward to the edge of the wood,
    and\r\npaused there a moment, his agile form erect, his brown locks flowing\r\nand
    his brown eyes watching the road; and a goodly sight he made, as the\r\nwind
    blew the ruddy color into his cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe highway led clear in the direction
    of the town, and thither he\r\nboldly directed his steps. But at a bend in the
    road he knew of a\r\nby-path leading across a brook which made the way nearer
    and less open,\r\ninto which he turned. As he approached the stream he saw that
    it had\r\nbecome swollen by recent rains into quite a pretty torrent. The log\r\nfoot-bridge
    was still there, but at this end of it a puddle intervened\r\nwhich could be
    crossed only with a leap, if you would not get your feet\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nBut Robin
    cared little for such a handicap. Taking a running start, his\r\nnimble legs
    carried him easily over and balanced neatly upon the end of\r\nthe broad log.
    But he was no sooner started across than he saw a tall\r\nstranger coming from
    the other side. Thereupon Robin quickened his pace,\r\nand the stranger did likewise,
    each thinking to cross first. Midway they\r\nmet, and neither would yield an
    inch.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive way, fellow!\u201D roared Robin, whose leadership of
    a band, I am\r\nafraid, had not tended to mend his manners.\r\n\r\nThe stranger
    smiled. He was almost a head taller than the other.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D he
    retorted, \u201Cfair and softly! I give way only to a better man\r\nthan myself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive
    way, I say\u201D, repeated Robin, \u201Cor I shall have to show you a better\r\nman.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis
    opponent budged not an inch, but laughed loudly. \u201CNow by my\r\nhalidom!\u201D
    he said good-naturedly, \u201CI would not move after hearing that\r\nspeech,
    even if minded to it before; for this better man I have sought\r\nmy life long.
    Therefore show him to me, an it please you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I right
    soon,\u201D quoth Robin. \u201CStay you here a little while,\r\ntill I cut me
    a cudgel like unto that you have been twiddling in your\r\nfingers.\u201D So
    saying he sought his own bank again with a leap, laid aside\r\nhis long bow and
    arrows, and cut him a stout staff of oak, straight,\r\nknotless, and a good six
    feet in length. But still it was a full foot\r\nshorter than his opponent\u2019s.
    Then back came he boldly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mind not telling you, fellow,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cthat a bout with archery\r\nwould have been an easier way with
    me. But there are other tunes in\r\nEngland besides that the arrow sings.\u201D
    Here he whirred the staff about\r\nhis head by way of practice. \u201CSo make
    you ready for the tune I am about\r\nto play upon your ribs. Have at you! One,
    two--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThree!\u201D roared the giant smiting at him instantly.\r\n\r\nWell
    was it for Robin that he was quick and nimble of foot; for the blow\r\nthat grazed
    a hair\u2019s breadth from his shoulder would have felled an ox.\r\nNevertheless
    while swerving to avoid this stroke, Robin was poising for\r\nhis own, and back
    came he forthwith--whack!\r\n\r\nWhack! parried the other.\r\n\r\nWhack! whack!
    whack! whack!\r\n\r\nThe fight waxed fast and furious. It was strength pitted
    against\r\nsubtlety, and the match was a merry one. The mighty blows of the\r\nstranger
    went whistling around Robin\u2019s ducking head, while his own swift\r\nundercuts
    were fain to give the other an attack of indigestion. Yet each\r\nstood firmly
    in his place not moving backward or forward a foot for a\r\ngood half hour, nor
    thinking of crying \u201CEnough!\u201D though some chance blow\r\nseemed likely
    to knock one or the other off the narrow foot-bridge. The\r\ngiant\u2019s face
    was getting red, and his breath came snorting forth like\r\na bull\u2019s. He
    stepped forward with a furious onslaught to finish this\r\naudacious fellow.
    Robin dodged his blows lightly, then sprang in swiftly\r\nand unexpectedly and
    dealt the stranger such a blow upon the short ribs\r\nthat you would have sworn
    the tanner was trimming down his hides for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe stranger reeled
    and came within an ace of falling, but regained his\r\nfooting right quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    my life, you can hit hard!\u201D he gasped forth, giving back a blow\r\nalmost
    while he was yet staggering.\r\n\r\nThis blow was a lucky one. It caught Robin
    off his guard. His stick had\r\nrested a moment while he looked to see the giant
    topple into the water,\r\nwhen down came the other upon his head, whack! Robin
    saw more stars\r\nin that one moment than all the astronomers have since discovered,
    and\r\nforthwith he dropped neatly into the stream.\r\n\r\nThe cool rushing current
    quickly brought him to his senses, howbeit he\r\nwas still so dazed that he groped
    blindly for the swaying reeds to\r\npull himself up on the bank. His assailant
    could not forbear laughing\r\nheartily at his plight, but was also quick to lend
    his aid. He thrust\r\ndown his long staff to Robin crying, \u201CLay hold of
    that, an your fists\r\nwhirl not so much as your head!\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin laid
    hold and was hauled to dry land for all the world like\r\na fish, except that
    the fish would never have come forth so wet and\r\ndripping. He lay upon the
    warm bank for a space to regain his senses.\r\nThen he sat up and gravely rubbed
    his pate.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy all the saints!\u201D said he, \u201Cyou hit full stoutly.
    My head hums like a\r\nhive of bees on a summer morning.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he
    seized his horn, which lay near, and blew thereon three shrill\r\nnotes that
    echoed against the trees. A moment of silence ensued, and\r\nthen was heard the
    rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs like the\r\ncoming of many men; and
    forth from the glade burst a score or two of\r\nstalwart yeomen, all clad in
    Lincoln green, like Robin, with good Will\r\nStutely and the widow\u2019s three
    sons at their head.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood master,\u201D cried Will Stutely, \u201Chow
    is this? In sooth there is not a\r\ndry thread on your body.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy,
    marry,\u201D replied Robin, \u201Cthis fellow would not let me pass the\r\nfootbridge,
    and when I tickled him in the ribs, he must needs answer by\r\na pat on the head
    which landed me overboard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen shall he taste some of his
    own porridge,\u201D quoth Will. \u201CSeize him,\r\nlads!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    let him go free,\u201D said Robin. \u201CThe fight was a fair one and I\r\nabide
    by it. I surmise you also are quits?\u201D he continued, turning to the\r\nstranger
    with a twinkling eye.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am content,\u201D said the other, \u201Cfor
    verily you now have the best end of\r\nthe cudgel. Wherefore, I like you well,
    and would fain know your name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy,\u201D said Robin, \u201Cmy
    men and even the Sheriff of Nottingham know me as\r\nRobin Hood, the outlaw.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen
    am I right sorry that I beat you,\u201D exclaimed the man, \u201Cfor I was\r\non
    my way to seek you and to try to join your merry company. But after\r\nmy unmannerly
    use of the cudgel, I fear we are still strangers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, never
    say it!\u201D cried Robin, \u201CI am glad I fell in with you; though,\r\nsooth
    to say, I did all the falling!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd amid a general laugh the two
    men clasped hands, and in that clasp\r\nthe strong friendship of a lifetime was
    begun.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you have not yet told us your name,\u201D said Robin,
    bethinking\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhence I came, men call me John Little.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEnter
    our company then, John Little; enter and welcome. The rites are\r\nfew, the fee
    is large. We ask your whole mind and body and heart even\r\nunto death.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    give the bond, upon my life,\u201D said the tall man.\r\n\r\nThereupon Will Stutely,
    who loved a good jest, spoke up and said: \u201CThe\r\ninfant in our household
    must be christened, and I\u2019ll stand godfather.\r\nThis fair little stranger
    is so small of bone and sinew, that his old\r\nname is not to the purpose.\u201D
    Here he paused long enough to fill a horn\r\nin the stream. \u201CHark ye, my
    son,\u201D--standing on tiptoe to splash the\r\nwater on the giant--\u201Ctake
    your new name on entering the forest. I\r\nchristen you Little John.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt
    this jest the men roared long and loud.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive him a bow, and find
    a full sheath of arrows for Little John,\u201D\r\n said Robin joyfully. \u201CCan
    you shoot as well as fence with the staff, my\r\nfriend?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have hit an ash twig at forty yards,\u201D said Little John.\r\n\r\nThus chatting
    pleasantly the band turned back into the woodland and\r\nsought their secluded
    dell, where the trees were the thickest, the moss\r\nwas the softest, and a secret
    path led to a cave, at once a retreat and\r\na stronghold. Here under a mighty
    oak they found the rest of the band,\r\nsome of whom had come in with a brace
    of fat does. And here they built\r\na ruddy fire and sat down to the meat and
    ale, Robin Hood in the center\r\nwith Will Stutely on the one hand and Little
    John on the other. And\r\nRobin was right well pleased with the day\u2019s adventure,
    even though he\r\nhad got a drubbing; for sore ribs and heads will heal, and
    \u2018tis not\r\nevery day that one can find a recruit as stout of bone and true
    of soul\r\nas Little John.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD
    TURNED BUTCHER, AND ENTERED THE SHERIFF\u2019S SERVICE\r\n\r\n     The butcher
    he answered jolly Robin,\r\n     \u201CNo matter where I do dwell,\r\n     For
    a butcher am I, and to Nottingham\r\n     Am I going, my flesh to sell.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    next morning the weather had turned ill, and Robin Hood\u2019s band\r\nstayed
    close to their dry and friendly cave. The third day brought a\r\ndiversion in
    the shape of a trap by a roving party of the Sheriff\u2019s men.\r\nA fine stag
    had been struck down by one Of Will Stutely\u2019s fellows, and\r\nhe and others
    had stepped forth from the covert to seize it, when twenty\r\nbowmen from Nottingham
    appeared at the end of the glade. Down dropped\r\nWill\u2019s men on all fours,
    barely in time to hear a shower of arrows\r\nwhistle above their heads. Then
    from behind the friendly trees they\r\nsent back such a welcome that the Sheriff\u2019s
    men deemed it prudent not to\r\ntarry in their steps. Two of them, in sooth,
    bore back unpleasant wounds\r\nin their shoulders, from the encounter.\r\n\r\nWhen
    they returned to town the Sheriff waxed red with rage.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat,\u201D
    he gasped, \u201Cdo my men fear to fight this Robin Hood, face to\r\nface? Would
    that I could get him within my reach, once. We should see\r\nthen; we should
    see!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhat it was the Sheriff would see, he did not state. But he
    was to have\r\nhis wish granted in short space, and you and I will see how he
    profited\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day and the one following this friendly
    bout, Little John was\r\nmissing. One of his men said that he saw him talking
    with a beggar, but\r\ndid not know whither they had gone. Two more days passed.
    Robin grew\r\nuneasy. He did not doubt the faith of Little John, but he was fearful\r\nlest
    a roving band of Foresters had captured him.\r\n\r\nAt last Robin could not remain
    quiet. Up sprang he, with bow and arrows,\r\nand a short sword at his side.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    must away to Nottingham town, my men,\u201D he cried. \u201CThe goodly Sheriff\r\nhas
    long desired to see me; and mayhap he can tell me tidings of the\r\nbest quarter-staff
    in the shire\u201D--meaning Little John.\r\n\r\nOthers of the band besought him
    to let them go with him, but he would\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D he said
    smilingly, \u201Cthe Sheriff and I are too good friends to put\r\ndoubt upon
    our meeting. But tarry ye in the edge of the wood opposite\r\nthe west gate of
    the town, and ye may be of service ere to-morrow\r\nnight.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying
    he strode forward to the road leading to Nottingham, and stood\r\nas before looking
    up and down to see if the way was clear. Back at a\r\nbend in the road he heard
    a rumbling and a lumbering, when up drove\r\na stout butcher, whistling gaily,
    and driving a mare that sped slowly\r\nenough because of the weight of meat with
    which the cart was loaded.\r\n\r\n\u201CA good morrow to you, friend,\u201D hailed
    Robin. \u201CWhence come you and where\r\ngo you with your load of meat?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    good morrow to you,\u201D returned the butcher, civilly enough. \u201CNo matter\r\nwhere
    I dwell. I am but a simple butcher, and to Nottingham am I going,\r\nmy flesh
    to sell. \u2018Tis Fair week, and my beef and mutton should fetch a\r\nfair penny,\u201D
    and he laughed loudly at his jest. \u201CBut whence come you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    yeoman am I, from Lockesley town. Men call me Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    saints forefend that you should treat me ill!\u201D said the butcher in\r\nterror.
    \u201COft have I heard of you, and how you lighten the purses of the\r\nfat priests
    and knights. But I am naught but a poor butcher, selling\r\nthis load of meat,
    perchance, for enough to pay my quarter\u2019s rent.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRest
    you, my friend, rest you,\u201D quoth Robin, \u201Cnot so much as a silver\r\npenny
    would I take from you, for I love an honest Saxon face and a fair\r\nname with
    my neighbors. But I would strike a bargain with you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHere he took
    from his girdle a well-filled purse, and continued, \u201CI\r\nwould fain be
    a butcher, this day, and sell meat at Nottingham town.\r\nCould you sell me your
    meat, your cart, your mare, and your good-will,\r\nwithout loss, for five marks?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHeaven
    bless ye, good Robin,\u201D cried the butcher right joyfully, \u201Cthat\r\ncan
    I!\u201D And he leaped down forthwith from the cart, and handed Robin the\r\nreins
    in exchange for the purse.\r\n\r\n\u201COne moment more,\u201D laughed Robin,
    \u201Cwe must e\u2019en change garments for the\r\nnonce. Take mine and scurry
    home quickly lest the King\u2019s Foresters try\r\nto put a hole through this
    Lincoln green.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying he donned the butcher\u2019s blouse and
    apron, and, climbing into\r\nthe cart, drove merrily down the road to the town.\r\n\r\nWhen
    he came to Nottingham he greeted the scowling gate-keeper blithely\r\nand proceeded
    to the market-place. Boldly he led his shuffling horse to\r\nthe place where
    the butchers had their stalls.\r\n\r\nHe had no notion of the price to ask for
    his meat, but put on a foolish\r\nand simple air as he called aloud his wares:\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CHark ye, lasses and dames, hark ye,\r\n     Good meat come buy, come buy,\r\n    
    Three pen\u2019orths go for one penny,\r\n     And a kiss is good, say I!\u201D\r\n\r\nNow
    when the folk found what a simple butcher he was, they crowded\r\naround his
    cart; for he really did sell three times as much for one\r\npenny as was sold
    by the other butchers. And one or two serving-lasses\r\nwith twinkling eyes liked
    his comely face so well that they willingly\r\ngave boot of a kiss.\r\n\r\nBut
    the other butchers were wroth when they found how he was taking\r\ntheir trade;
    and they accordingly put their heads together.\r\n\r\nOne said, \u201CHe is a
    prodigal and has sold his father\u2019s land, and this is\r\nhis first venture
    in trading.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother said, \u201CHe is a thief who has murdered a
    butcher, and stolen his\r\nhorse and meat.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin heard these sayings,
    but only laughed merrily and sang his song\r\nthe louder. His good-humor made
    the people laugh also and crowd round\r\nhis cart closely, shouting uproariously
    when some buxom lass submitted\r\nto be kissed.\r\n\r\nThen the butchers saw
    that they must meet craft with craft; and they\r\nsaid to him, \u201CCome, brother
    butcher, if you would sell meat with us, you\r\nmust e\u2019en join our guild
    and stand by the rules of our trade.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe dine at the Sheriff\u2019s
    mansion to-day,\u201D said another, \u201Cand you must\r\ntake one of our party.\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CAccurst of his heart,\u201D said jolly Robin,\r\n     \u201CThat a butcher
    will deny.\r\n     I\u2019ll go with you, my brethren true,\r\n     And as fast
    as I can hie.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhereupon, having sold all his meat, he left his horse
    and cart in\r\ncharge of a friendly hostler and prepared to follow his mates
    to the\r\nMansion House.\r\n\r\nIt was the Sheriff\u2019s custom to dine various
    guilds of the trade, from\r\ntime to time, on Fair days, for he got a pretty
    profit out of the fees\r\nthey paid him for the right to trade in the market-place.
    The Sheriff\r\nwas already come with great pomp into the banqueting room, when
    Robin\r\nHood and three or four butchers entered, and he greeted them all with\r\ngreat
    condescension; and presently the whole of a large company was\r\nseated at a
    table groaning beneath the good cheer of the feast.\r\n\r\nNow the Sheriff bade
    Robin sit by his right hand, at the head of the\r\nboard; for one or two butchers
    had whispered to the official, \u201CThat\r\nfellow is a right mad blade, who
    yet made us much sport to-day. He sold\r\nmore meat for one penny than we could
    sell for three; and he gave extra\r\nweight to whatsoever lass would buss him.\u201D
    And others said, \u201CHe is\r\nsome prodigal who knows not the value of goods,
    and may be plucked by a\r\nshrewd man right closely.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff
    was will to pluck a prodigal with the next man, and he was\r\nmoreover glad to
    have a guest who promised to enliven the feast. So, as\r\nI have told you, he
    placed Robin by his side, and he made much of him\r\nand laughed boisterously
    at his jests; though sooth to say, the laugh\r\nwere come by easily, for Robin
    had never been in merrier mood, and his\r\nquips and jests soon put the whole
    table at a roar.\r\n\r\nThen my lord Bishop of Hereford came in, last of all,
    to say a ponderous\r\ngrace and take his seat on the other side of the Sheriff--the
    prelate\u2019s\r\nfat body showing up in goodly contrast to the other\u2019s
    lean bones.\r\n\r\nAfter grace was said, and while the servants clattered in
    with the meat\r\nplatters, Robin stood up and said:\r\n\r\n\u201CAn amen say
    I to my lord Bishop\u2019s thanks! How, now, my fine fellows, be\r\nmerry and
    drink deep; for the shot I\u2019ll pay ere I go my way, though it\r\ncost me
    five pounds and more. So my lords and gentlemen all, spare not\r\nthe wine, but
    fall to lustily.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHear! hear!\u201D shouted the butchers.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow
    are you a right jolly soul,\u201D quoth the Sheriff, \u201Cbut this feast is\r\nmine
    own. Howbeit you must have many a head of horned beasts, and many\r\nan acre
    of broad land, to spend from your purse so freely.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, that
    have I,\u201D returned Robin, his eyes all a twinkle, \u201Cfive\r\nhundred horned
    beasts have I and my brothers, and none of them have we\r\nbeen able to sell.
    That is why I have turned butcher. But I know not the\r\ntrade, and would gladly
    sell the whole herd, an I could find a buyer.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this, the Sheriff\u2019s
    greed \u2018gan to rise. Since this fool _would_ be\r\nplucked, thought he, why
    should not he do the plucking?\r\n\r\n\u201CFive hundred beasts, say you?\u201D
    he queried sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201CFive hundred and ten fat beasts by actual count,
    that I would sell for\r\na just figure. Aye, to him who will pay me in right
    money, would I sell\r\nthem for twenty pieces of gold. Is that too much to ask,
    lording?\u201D\r\n\r\nWas there ever such an idiot butcher? thought the Sheriff;
    and he so far\r\nforgot his dignity as to nudge the Bishop in his fat ribs.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    good fellow,\u201D quoth he chuckling, \u201CI am always ready to help\r\nany
    in my shire. An you cannot find a buyer for your herd at this just\r\nfigure,
    I will e\u2019en buy them myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this generosity Robin was quite
    overcome, and fell to praising the\r\nSheriff to the skies, and telling him that
    he should not have cause to\r\nforget the kindness.\r\n\r\n\u201CTut, tut,\u201D
    said the Sheriff, \u201C\u2018tis naught but a trade. Drive in your\r\nherd tomorrow
    to the market-place and you shall have money down.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, excellence,\u201D
    said Robin, \u201Cthat can I not easily do, for they are\r\ngrazing in scattered
    fashion. But they are over near Gamewell, not more\r\nthan a mile therefrom at
    most. Will you not come and choose your own\r\nbeasts tomorrow?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    that I will,\u201D said the Sheriff, his cupidity casting his caution\r\nto the
    winds. \u201CTarry with me over night, and I will go with you in the\r\nmorning.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis
    was a poser for Robin, since he liked not the idea of staying over\r\nnight at
    the Sheriff\u2019s house. He had hoped to appoint a meeting-place\r\nfor the
    other, but now saw that this might excite doubt. He looked\r\naround at the company.
    By this time, you must know, the feast had\r\nprogressed far, and the butchers
    were deep in their cups. The Sheriff\r\nand Robin had talked in a low voice,
    and my lord Bishop was almost\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CAgreed,\u201D said Robin
    presently, and the words were no sooner out of his\r\nmouth than the door opened
    and a serving-man entered bearing tray of\r\nmulled wine. At sight of the fellow\u2019s
    face, Robin gave an involuntary\r\nstart of surprise which was instantly checked.
    The other also saw him,\r\nstood still a moment, and as if forgetting something
    turned about and\r\nleft the hall.\r\n\r\nIt was Little John.\r\n\r\nA dozen
    questions flashed across Robin\u2019s mind, and he could find answer\r\nfor none
    of them. What was Little John doing in the Sheriff\u2019s house? Why\r\nhad he
    not told the band? Was he true to them? Would he betray him?\r\n\r\nBut these
    questions of distrust were dismissed from Robin\u2019s open mind\r\nas soon as
    they had entered. He knew that Little John was faithful and\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nHe
    recovered his spirits and began again upon a vein of foolish banter,\r\nfor the
    amusement of the Sheriff and his guests, all being now merry\r\nwith wine.\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    song!\u201D one of them shouted, and the cry was taken up round the table.\r\nRobin
    mounted his chair and trolled forth:\r\n\r\n     \u201CA lass and a butcher of
    Nottingham\r\n     Agreed \u2018twixt them for to wed.\r\n     Says he, \u2018I\u2019ll
    give ye the meat, fair dame,\r\n     And ye will give me the bread.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    they joined in the chorus amid a pounding of cups upon the board:\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CWith a hey and a ho\r\n     And a hey nonny no,\r\n     A butcher of Nottingham!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile
    the song was at its height, Little John reappeared, with other\r\nservants, and
    refilled the cups. He came up to Robin and, as if asking\r\nhim if he would have
    more wine, said softly, \u201CMeet me in the pantry\r\nto-night.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin
    nodded, and sang loudly. The day was already far spent, and\r\npresently the
    company broke up with many hiccupy bows of the Sheriff and\r\nlittle notice of
    the drowsy Bishop.\r\n\r\nWhen the company was dispersed, the Sheriff bade a
    servant show Robin to\r\nhis room, and promised to see him at breakfast the next
    day.\r\n\r\nRobin kept his word and met Little John that night, and the sheriff
    next\r\nday; but Little John has been doing so much in the meantime that he must\r\nbe
    allowed a chapter to himself.\r\n\r\nSo let us turn to another story that was
    sung of, in the ballads of\r\nolden time, and find out how Little John entered
    the Sheriff\u2019s service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHOW LITTLE JOHN
    ENTERED THE SHERIFF\u2019S SERVICE\r\n\r\n     List and hearken, gentlemen,\r\n    
    All ye that now be here,\r\n     Of Little John, that was Knight\u2019s-man,\r\n    
    Good mirth ye now shall hear.\r\n\r\nIt had come around another Fair day at Nottingham
    town, and folk crowded\r\nthere by all the gates. Goods of many kinds were displayed
    in gaily\r\ncolored booths, and at every cross-street a free show was in progress.\r\nHere
    and there, stages had been erected for the play at quarter-staff, a\r\nhighly
    popular sport.\r\n\r\nThere was a fellow, one Eric of Lincoln, who was thought
    to be the\r\nfinest man with the staff for miles around. His feats were sung
    about in\r\nballads through all the shire. A great boaster was he withal, and
    to-day\r\nhe strutted about on one of these corner stages, and vaunted of his\r\nprowess,
    and offered to crack any man\u2019s crown for a shilling. Several\r\nhad tried
    their skill with Eric, but he had soon sent them spinning in\r\nno gentle manner,
    amid the jeers and laughter of the onlookers.\r\n\r\nA beggar-man sat over against
    Eric\u2019s stage and grinned every time a pate\r\nwas cracked. He was an uncouth
    fellow, ragged and dirty and unshaven.\r\nEric caught sight of his leering face
    at one of his boasts--for there\r\nwas a lull in the game, because no man else
    wanted to come within reach\r\nof Eric\u2019s blows. Eric, I say, noticed the
    beggar-man grinning at him\r\nrather impudently, and turned toward him sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow
    now, you dirty villain!\u201D quoth he, \u201Cmend your manners to your\r\nbetters,
    or, by our Lady, I\u2019ll dust your rags for you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe beggar-man
    still grinned. \u201CI am always ready to mend my manners to\r\nmy betters,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cbut I am afraid you cannot teach me any better\r\nthan you can
    dust my jacket.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome up! Come up!\u201D roared the other,
    flourishing his staff.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I,\u201D said the beggar, getting
    up slowly and with difficulty.\r\n\u201CIt will pleasure me hugely to take a
    braggart down a notch, an some\r\ngood man will lend me a stout quarter-staff.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt
    this a score of idlers reached him their staves--being ready enough\r\nto see
    another man have his head cracked, even if they wished to save\r\ntheir own--and
    he took the stoutest and heaviest of all. He made a sorry\r\nenough figure as
    he climbed awkwardly upon the stage, but when he had\r\ngained it, he towered
    full half a head above the other, for all his\r\nawkwardness. Nathless, he held
    his stick so clumsily that the crowd\r\nlaughed in great glee.\r\n\r\nNow each
    man took his place and looked the other up and down, watching\r\nwarily for an
    opening. Only a moment stood they thus, for Eric, intent\r\non teaching this
    rash beggar a lesson and sweeping him speedily off the\r\nstage, launched forth
    boldly and gave the other a sounding crack on the\r\nshoulder. The beggar danced
    about, and made as though he would drop his\r\nstaff from very pain, while the
    crowd roared and Eric raised himself for\r\nanother crushing blow. But just then
    the awkward beggar came to life.\r\nStraightening himself like a flash, he dealt
    Eric a back-handed blow,\r\nthe like of which he had never before seen. Down
    went the boaster to the\r\nfloor with a sounding thump, and the fickle people
    yelled and laughed\r\nthemselves purple; for it was a new sight to see Eric of
    Lincoln eating\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nBut he was up again almost as soon as he had fallen,
    and right quickly\r\nretreated to his own ringside to gather his wits and watch
    for an\r\nopening. He saw instantly that he had no easy antagonist, and he came
    in\r\ncautiously this time.\r\n\r\nAnd now those who stood around saw the merriest
    game of quarter-staff\r\nthat was ever played inside the walls of Nottingham
    town. Both men\r\nwere on their guard and fenced with fine skill, being well
    matched in\r\nprowess. Again and again did Eric seek to force an opening under
    the\r\nother\u2019s guard, and just as often were his blows parried. The beggar\r\nstood
    sturdily in his tracks contenting himself with beating off the\r\nattack. For
    a long time their blows met like the steady crackling of\r\nsome huge forest
    fire, and Eric strove to be wary, for he now knew that\r\nthe other had no mean
    wits or mettle. But he grew right mad at last, and\r\nbegan to send down blows
    so fierce and fast that you would have sworn\r\na great hail-storm was pounding
    on the shingles over your head. Yet he\r\nnever so much as entered the tall beggar\u2019s
    guard.\r\n\r\nThen at last the stranger saw his chance and changed his tune of\r\nfighting.
    With one upward stroke he sent Eric\u2019s staff whirling through\r\nthe air.
    With another he tapped Eric on the head; and, with a third\r\nbroad swing, ere
    the other could recover himself, he swept him clear off\r\nthe stage, much as
    you would brush a fly off the window pane.\r\n\r\nNow the people danced and shouted
    and made so much ado that the\r\nshop-keepers left their stalls and others came
    running from every\r\ndirection. The victory of the queer beggar made him immensely
    popular.\r\nEric had been a great bully, and many had suffered defeat and insult\r\nat
    his hands. So the ragged stranger found money and food and drink\r\neverywhere
    at his disposal, and he feasted right comfortably till the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThen
    a long bow contest came on, and to it the beggar went with some of\r\nhis new
    friends. It was held in the same arena that Robin had formerly\r\nentered; and
    again the Sheriff and lords and ladies graced the scene\r\nwith their presence,
    while the people crowded to their places.\r\n\r\nWhen the archers had stepped
    forward, the herald rose and proclaimed the\r\nrules of the game: how that each
    man should shoot three shots, and to\r\nhim who shot best the prize of a yoke
    of fat steers should belong.\r\nA dozen keen-eyed bowmen were there, and among
    them some of the best\r\nfellows in the Forester\u2019s and Sheriff\u2019s companies.
    Down at the end of\r\nthe line towered the tall beggar-man, who must needs twang
    a bow-string\r\nwith the best of them.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff noted his queer figure
    and asked: \u201CWho is that ragged\r\nfellow?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis he
    that hath but now so soundly cracked the crown of Eric of\r\nLincoln,\u201D was
    the reply.\r\n\r\nThe shooting presently began, and the targets soon showed a
    fine\r\nreckoning. Last of all came the beggar\u2019s turn.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy your
    leave,\u201D he said loudly, \u201CI\u2019d like it well to shoot with any\r\nother
    man here present at a mark of my own placing.\u201D And he strode down\r\nthe
    lists with a slender peeled sapling which he stuck upright in the\r\nground.
    \u201CThere,\u201D said he, \u201Cis a right good mark. Will any man try it?\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    not an archer would risk his reputation on so small a target.\r\n\r\nWhereupon
    the beggar drew his bow with seeming carelessness and split\r\nthe wand with
    his shaft.\r\n\r\n\u201CLong live the beggar!\u201D yelled the bystanders.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff swore a full great oath, and said: \u201CThis man is the best\r\narcher
    that ever yet I saw.\u201D And he beckoned to him, and asked him: \u201CHow\r\nnow,
    good fellow, what is your name, and in what country were you born?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn
    Holderness I was born,\u201D the man replied; \u201Cmen call me Reynold\r\nGreenleaf.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    are a sturdy fellow, Reynold Greenleaf, and deserve better apparel\r\nthan that
    you wear at present. Will you enter my service? I will give\r\nyou twenty marks
    a year, above your living, and three good suits of\r\nclothes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThree
    good suits, say you? Then right gladly will I enter your service,\r\nfor my back
    has been bare this many a long day.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Reynold turned him about
    to the crowd and shouted: \u201CHark ye, good\r\npeople, I have entered the Sheriff\u2019s
    service, and need not the yoke of\r\nsteers for prize. So take them for yourselves,
    to feast withal.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this the crowd shouted more merrily than ever,
    and threw their caps\r\nhigh into the air. And none so popular a man had come
    to Nottingham town\r\nin many a long day as this same Reynold Greenleaf.\r\n\r\nNow
    you may have guessed, by this time, who Reynold Greenleaf really\r\nwas; so I
    shall tell you that he was none other than Little John. And\r\nforth went he
    to the Sheriff\u2019s house, and entered his service. But it\r\nwas a sorry day
    for the Sheriff when he got his new man. For Little John\r\nwinked his shrewd
    eye and said softly to himself: \u201CBy my faith, I shall\r\nbe the worst servant
    to him that ever yet had he!\u201D\r\n\r\nTwo days passed by. Little John, it
    must be confessed, did not make\r\na good servant. He insisted upon eating the
    Sheriff\u2019s best bread and\r\ndrinking his best wine, so that the steward
    waxed wroth. Nathless the\r\nSheriff held him in high esteem, and made great
    talk of taking him along\r\non the next hunting trip.\r\n\r\nIt was now the day
    of the banquet to the butchers, about which we have\r\nalready heard. The banquet
    hall, you must know, was not in the main\r\nhouse, but connected with it by a
    corridor. All the servants were\r\nbustling about making preparations for the
    feast, save only Little John,\r\nwho must needs lie abed the greater part of
    the day. But he presented\r\nhimself at last, when the dinner was half over;
    and being desirous\r\nof seeing the guests for himself he went into the hall
    with the other\r\nservants to pass the wine. First, however, I am afraid that
    some of\r\nthe wine passed his own lips while he went down the corridor. When
    he\r\nentered the banqueting hall, whom should he see but Robin Hood himself.\r\nWe
    can imagine the start of surprise felt by each of these bold fellows\r\nupon
    seeing the other in such strange company. But they kept their\r\nsecrets, as
    we have seen, and arranged to meet each other that same\r\nnight. Meanwhile,
    the proud Sheriff little knew that he harbored the two\r\nchief outlaws of the
    whole countryside beneath his roof.\r\n\r\nAfter the feast was over and night
    was beginning to advance, Little John\r\nfelt faint of stomach and remembered
    him that he had eaten nothing all\r\nthat day. Back went he to the pantry to
    see what eatables were laid by.\r\nBut there, locking up the stores for the night,
    stood the fat steward.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood Sir Steward,\u201D said Little John,
    \u201Cgive me to dine, for it is long\r\nfor Greenleaf to be fasting.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    steward looked grimly at him and rattled the keys at his girdle.\r\n\r\n\u201CSirrah
    lie-abed,\u201D quoth he, \u201C\u2018tis late in the day to be talking of\r\neating.
    Since you have waited thus long to be hungry, you can e\u2019en take\r\nyour
    appetite back to bed again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by mine appetite, that will
    I not do,\u201D cried Little John. \u201CYour\r\nown paunch of fat would be enough
    for any bear to sleep on through the\r\nwinter. But my stomach craves food, and
    food it shall have!\u201D\r\n\r\nSaying this he brushed past the steward and
    tried the door, but it\r\nwas locked fast; whereat the fat steward chuckled and
    jangled his keys\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen was Little John right mad, and he brought
    down his huge fist on the\r\ndoor-panel with a sledge-hammer blow that shivered
    an opening you could\r\nthrust your hand into. Little John stooped and peered
    through the hole\r\nto see what food lay within reach, when crack! went the steward\u2019s
    keys\r\nupon his crown, and the worthy danced around him playing a tattoo that\r\nmade
    Little John\u2019s ears ring. At this he turned upon the steward and\r\ngave
    him such a rap that his back went nigh in two, and over went the\r\nfat fellow
    rolling on the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201CLie there,\u201D quoth Little John, \u201Ctill
    ye find strength to go to bed.\r\nMeanwhile, I must be about my dinner.\u201D
    And he kicked open the buttery\r\ndoor without ceremony and brought to light
    a venison pasty and cold\r\nroast pheasant--goodly sights to a hungry man. Placing
    these down on a\r\nconvenient shelf he fell to with right good will. So Little
    John ate and\r\ndrank as much as he would.\r\n\r\nNow the Sheriff had in his
    kitchen a cook, a stout man and bold, who\r\nheard the rumpus and came in to
    see how the land lay. There sat Little\r\nJohn eating away for dear life, while
    the fat steward was rolled under\r\nthe table like a bundle of rags.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    make my vow!\u201D said the cook, \u201Cyou are a shrewd hind to dwell thus in\r\na
    household, and ask thus to dine.\u201D So saying he laid aside his spit and\r\ndrew
    a good sword that hung at his side.\r\n\r\n\u201CI make my vow!\u201D said Little
    John, \u201Cyou are a bold man and hardy to come\r\nthus between me and my meat.
    So defend yourself and see that you prove\r\nthe better man.\u201D And he drew
    his own sword and crossed weapons with the\r\ncook.\r\n\r\nThen back and forth
    they clashed with sullen sound. The old ballad which\r\ntells of their fight
    says that they thought nothing for to flee, but\r\nstiffly for to stand. There
    they fought sore together, two miles away\r\nand more, but neither might the
    other harm for the space of a full hour.\r\n\r\n\u201CI make my vow!\u201D cried
    Little John, \u201Cyou are the best swordsman that\r\never yet I saw. What say
    you to resting a space and eating and drinking\r\ngood health with me. Then we
    may fall to again with the swords.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAgreed!\u201D said the
    cook, who loved good fare as well as a good fight;\r\nand they both laid by their
    swords and fell to the food with hearty\r\nwill. The venison pasty soon disappeared,
    and the roast pheasant flew\r\nat as lively a rate as ever the bird itself had
    sped. Then the warriors\r\nrested a space and patted their stomachs, and smiled
    across at\r\neach other like bosom friends; for a man when he as dined looks
    out\r\npleasantly upon the world.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now good Reynold Greenleaf,\u201D
    said the cook, \u201Cwe may as well settle\r\nthis brave fight we have in hand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    true saying,\u201D rejoined the other, \u201Cbut first tell me, friend--for\r\nI
    protest you are my friend henceforth--what is the score we have to\r\nsettle?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNaught
    save who can handle the sword best,\u201D said the cook. \u201CBy my troth\r\nI
    had thought to carve you like a capon ere now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I had long
    since thought to shave your ears,\u201D replied Little John.\r\n\u201CThis bout
    we can settle in right good time. But just now I and my\r\nmaster have need of
    you, and you can turn your stout blade to better\r\nservice than that of the
    Sheriff.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhose service would that be?\u201D asked the cook.\r\n\r\n\u201CMine,\u201D
    answered a would-be butcher entering the room, \u201Cand I am Robin\r\nHood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    V\r\n\r\nHOW THE SHERIFF LOST THREE GOOD SERVANTS AND FOUND THEM AGAIN\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CMake good cheer,\u201D said Robin Hood.\r\n     \u201CSheriff! for charity!\r\n    
    And for the love of Little John\r\n     Thy life is granted thee!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    cook gasped in amazement. This Robin Hood! and under the Sheriff\u2019s\r\nvery
    roof!\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by my troth you are a brave fellow,\u201D he said. \u201CI
    have heard great\r\ntales of your prowess, and the half has not been told. But
    who might\r\nthis tall slasher be?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMen do call me Little John,
    good fellow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen Little John, or Reynold Greenleaf, I like
    you well, on my honor as\r\nMuch the miller\u2019s son; and you too, bold Robin
    Hood. An you take me, I\r\nwill enter your service right gladly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSpoken
    like a stout man!\u201D said Robin, seizing him by the hand. \u201CBut I\r\nmust
    back to my own bed, lest some sleepy warden stumble upon me, and\r\nI be forced
    to run him through. Lucky for you twain that wine flowed\r\nso freely in the
    house to-day; else the noise of your combat would have\r\nbrought other onlookers
    besides Robin Hood. Now if ye would flee the\r\nhouse to-night, I will join you
    in the good greenwood to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, good master,\u201D said
    the cook, \u201Cyou would not stay here over night!\r\nVerily, it is running
    your head into a noose. Come with us. The Sheriff\r\nhas set strict watch on
    all the gates, since \u2018tis Fair week, but I know\r\nthe warden at the west
    gate and could bring us through safely. To-morrow\r\nyou will be stayed.\u201D
    \u201CNay, that will I not,\u201D laughed Robin, \u201Cfor I shall\r\ngo through
    with no less escort than the Sheriff himself. Now do you,\r\nLittle John, and
    do you, Much the miller\u2019s son, go right speedily. In\r\nthe borders of the
    wood you will find my merry men. Tell them to kill\r\ntwo fine harts against
    to-morrow eve, for we shall have great company\r\nand lordly sport.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    Robin left them as suddenly as he had come.\r\n\r\n\u201CComrade,\u201D then
    said Little John, \u201Cwe may as well bid the Sheriff\u2019s roof\r\nfarewell.
    But ere we go, it would seem a true pity to fail to take such\r\nof the Sheriff\u2019s
    silver plate as will cause us to remember him, and also\r\ngrace our special
    feasts.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis well said indeed,\u201D quoth the cook.\r\n\r\nThereupon
    they got a great sack and filled it with silver plate from the\r\nshelves where
    it would not at once be missed, and they swung the sack\r\nbetween them, and
    away they went, out of the house, out of the town, and\r\ninto the friendly shelter
    of Sherwood Forest.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the servants were late astir in the
    Sheriff\u2019s house.\r\nThe steward awoke from a heavy sleep, but his cracked
    head was still in\r\nsuch a whirl that he could not have sworn whether the Sheriff
    had ever\r\nowned so much as one silver dish. So the theft went undiscovered
    for the\r\nnonce.\r\n\r\nRobin Hood met the Sheriff at breakfast, when his host
    soon spoke of\r\nwhat was uppermost in his heart--the purchase of the fine herd
    of cattle\r\nnear Gamewell. \u2018Twas clear that a vision of them, purchased
    for twenty\r\npaltry gold pieces, had been with him all through the night, in
    his\r\ndreams. And Robin again appeared such a silly fellow that the Sheriff\r\nsaw
    no need of dissembling, but said that he was ready to start at once\r\nto look
    at the herd.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they set forth, Robin in his little butcher\u2019s
    cart, behind\r\nthe lean mare, and the Sheriff mounted on a horse. Out of Nottingham\r\ntown,
    through gates open wide, they proceeded, and took the hill road\r\nleading through
    Sherwood Forest. And as they went on and plunged deeper\r\namong the trees, Robin
    whistled blithely and sang snatches of tunes.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy are you so gay,
    fellow?\u201D said the Sheriff, for, sooth to say, the\r\nsilence of the woods
    was making him uneasy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am whistling to keep my courage up,\u201D
    replied Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is there to fear, when you have the Sheriff
    of Nottingham beside\r\nyou?\u201D quoth the other pompously.\r\n\r\nRobin scratched
    his head.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey do say that Robin Hood and his men care little for
    the Sheriff,\u201D\r\n he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CPooh!\u201D said the Sheriff. \u201CI
    would not give _that_ for their lives, if\r\nI could once lay hands upon them.\u201D
    And he snapped his fingers angrily.\r\n\u201CBut Robin Hood himself was on this
    very road the last time I came to\r\ntown,\u201D said the other.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff
    started at the crackling of a twig under his horse\u2019s feet,\r\nand looked
    around.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you see him?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, that
    did I! He wanted the use of this mare and cart to drive to\r\nNottingham. He
    said he would fain turn butcher. But see!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he came to
    a turn in the road, and there before them stood a\r\nherd of the King\u2019s
    deer, feeding. Robin pointed to them and continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is my
    herd of cattle, good Master Sheriff! How do you like them?\r\nAre they not fat
    and fair to see?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff drew rein quickly. \u201CNow fellow,\u201D
    quoth he, \u201CI would I were\r\nwell out of this forest, for I care not to
    see such herds as these, or\r\nsuch faces as yours. Choose your own way, therefore,
    whoever you be, and\r\nlet me go mine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D laughed
    Robin, seizing the Sheriff\u2019s bridle, \u201CI have been at too\r\nmuch pains
    to cultivate your company to forego it now so easily. Besides\r\nI wish you to
    meet some of my friends and dine with me, since you have\r\nso lately entertained
    me at your board.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying he clapped a horn on his lips and winded
    three merry notes.\r\nThe deer bounded away; and before the last of them was
    seen, there came\r\na running and a rustling, and out from behind covert and
    tree came full\r\ntwoscore of men, clad in Lincoln green, and bearing good yew
    bows in\r\ntheir hands and short swords at their sides. Up they ran to Robin
    Hood\r\nand doffed their caps to him respectfully, while the Sheriff sat still\r\nfrom
    very amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201CWelcome to the greenwood!\u201D said one of the
    leaders, bending the knee\r\nwith mock reverence before the Sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff glared. It was Little John.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoe the worth, Reynold Greenleaf,\u201D
    he said, \u201Cyou have betrayed me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI make my vow,\u201D
    said Little John, \u201Cthat you are to blame, master. I was\r\nmisserved of
    my dinner, when I was at your house. But we shall set you\r\ndown to a feast
    we hope you will enjoy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell spoken, Little John,\u201D said
    Robin Hood. \u201CTake you his bridle and\r\nlet us do honor to the guest who
    has come to feast with us.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen turning abruptly the whole company
    plunged into the heart of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAfter twisting and turning till
    the Sheriff\u2019s bewildered head sat\r\ndizzily upon his shoulders, the greenwood
    men passed through a narrow\r\nalley amid the trees which led to a goodly open
    space flanked by\r\nwide-spreading oaks. Under the largest of these a pleasant
    fire was\r\ncrackling, and near it two fine harts lay ready for cooking. Around
    the\r\nblaze were gathered another company of yeomen quite as large as that\r\nwhich
    came with Robin Hood. Up sprang they as the latter advanced and\r\nsaluted their
    leader with deference, but with hearty gladness to see him\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nThat
    merry wag Will Stutely was in command; and when he saw the\r\npalefaced Sheriff
    being led in like any culprit, he took his cloak and\r\nlaid it humbly upon the
    ground and besought the Sheriff to alight upon\r\nit, as the ground of Sherwood
    was unused to such dignitaries.\r\n\r\n\u201CBestir yourselves, good fellows!\u201D
    cried Robin Hood; \u201Cand while our new\r\ncook, whom I see with us, is preparing
    a feast worthy of our high guest,\r\nlet us have a few games to do him honor!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    while the whole glade was filled with the savory smell of roasting\r\nvenison
    and fat capons, and brown pasties warmed beside the blaze,\r\nand mulled wine
    sent forth a cordial fragrance, Robin Hood placed the\r\nSheriff upon a knoll
    beneath the largest oak and sat himself down by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFirst stepped
    forward several pairs of men armed with the quarter-staff,\r\nthe widow\u2019s
    sons among them, and so skilfully did they thrust and parry\r\nand beat down
    guards, that the Sheriff, who loved a good game as well as\r\nany man, clapped
    his hands, forgetting where he was, and shouted, \u201CWell\r\nstruck! well struck!
    Never have I seen such blows at all the Fairs of\r\nNottingham!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    the best archers of the band set up a small wand at eightscore\r\npaces distant,
    and thereon they affixed a wreath of green. And the\r\narchers began to shoot;
    and he who shot not through the garland without\r\ndisturbing its leaves and
    tendrils was fain to submit to a good sound\r\nbuffet from Little John. But right
    cunning was the shooting, for the\r\nmen had spent a certain time in daily practice,
    and many were the shafts\r\nwhich sped daintily through the circle. Nathless
    now and again some\r\nluckless fellow would shoot awry and would be sent winding
    from a long\r\narm blow from the tall lieutenant while the glade roared with
    laughter.\r\nAnd none more hearty a guffaw was given than came from the Sheriff\u2019s
    own\r\nthroat, for the spirit of the greenwood was upon him.\r\n\r\nBut presently
    his high mood was dashed. The company sat down to meat,\r\nand the guest was
    treated to two more disturbing surprise. The cook came\r\nforward to serve the
    food, when the Sheriff beheld in him his own former\r\nservant, and one whom
    he supposed was at the moment in the scullery at\r\nNottingham.\r\n\r\nMuch the
    miller\u2019s son grinned by way of answer to the Sheriff\u2019s\r\namazement,
    and served the plates, and placed them before the party. Then\r\ndid the Sheriff
    gasp and fairly choke with rage. The service was his own\r\nsilverware from the
    Mansion House!\r\n\r\n\u201CYou rascals! you rogues!\u201D he spluttered. \u201CWas
    it not enough to defraud\r\nme out of three of my servants, that you must also
    rob me of my best\r\nsilver service? Nay, by my life, but I will not touch your
    food!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Robin Hood bade him pause.\r\n\r\n\u201CGramercy!\u201D
    quoth he, \u201Cservants come and go, in merry England, and so\r\ndoes service.
    The platters are but used to do your worship honor. And as\r\nfor your life,
    it is forfeit to your eagerness to buy my herd of cattle\r\nso cheaply. Now sit
    you down again and make good cheer, Sheriff, for\r\ncharity! And for the love
    of Little John your life is granted you!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the Sheriff sat him
    down again, with the best face he could assume,\r\nand soon the cook\u2019s viands
    were disappearing down his gullet as rapidly\r\nas the next man\u2019s. And they
    feasted royally and clinked each other\u2019s\r\ncups until the sun had ceased
    to print the pattern of the leaves upon\r\nthe forest carpet.\r\n\r\nThen the
    Sheriff arose and said: \u201CI thank you, Robin Hood, one-time\r\nbutcher, and
    you, Little John, one-time beggar, and you, Much, one-time\r\ncook, and all you
    good men who have entertained me in Sherwood so well.\r\nPromises I make not
    as to how I shall requite you when next you come to\r\nNottingham, for I am in
    the King\u2019s service. So for the present the score\r\nrests with you. But
    the shadows grow long and I must away, if you will\r\nbe pleased to pilot me
    to the road.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Robin Hood and all his men arose and drank the
    Sheriff\u2019s health,\r\nand Robin said: \u201CIf you must needs go at once
    we will not detain\r\nyou--except that you have forgotten two things.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    may they be?\u201D asked the Sheriff, while his heart sank within him.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    forget that you came with me to-day to buy a herd of horned beasts;\r\nlikewise
    that he who dines at the Greenwood Inn must pay the landlord.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff fidgeted like a small boy who has forgotten his lesson.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    I have but a small sum with me,\u201D he began apologetically.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    is that sum, gossip?\u201D questioned Little John, \u201Cfor my own wage\r\nshould
    also come out of it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd mine!\u201D said Much.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    mine!\u201D smiled Robin.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff caught his breath. \u201CBy my troth,
    are all these silver dishes\r\nworth anything?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe outlaws roared
    heartily at this.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell you what it is, worship,\u201D
    said Robin, \u201Cwe three rascally\r\nservants will compound our back wages
    for those plates. And we will keep\r\nthe herd of cattle free for our own use--and
    the King\u2019s. But this little\r\ntavern bill should be settled! Now, what
    sum have you about you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have only those twenty pieces of
    gold, and twenty others,\u201D said the\r\nSheriff: and well it was that he told
    the truth for once, for Robin\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201CCount it, Little John.\u201D\r\n\r\nLittle
    John turned the Sheriff\u2019s wallet inside out. \u201C\u2018Tis true enough,\u201D\r\nhe
    said.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you shall pay no more than twenty pieces for your entertainment,\r\nexcellence,\u201D
    decreed Robin. \u201CSpeak I soothly, men of greenwood?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood!\u201D
    echoed the others.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Sheriff should swear by his patron saint
    that he will not molest\r\nus,\u201D said Will Stutely; and his addition was
    carried unanimously.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo be it, then,\u201D cried Little John, approaching
    the sheriff. \u201CNow swear\r\nby your life and your patron saint--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will swear it by St. George, who is patron of us all,\u201D said the\r\nSheriff
    vigorously, \u201Cthat I will never disturb or distress the outlaws\r\nin Sherwood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    let me catch any of you _out_ of Sherwood!\u201D thought he to himself.\r\n\r\nThen
    the twenty pieces of gold were paid over, and the Sheriff once more\r\nprepared
    to depart.\r\n\r\n\u201CNever had we so worshipful a guest before,\u201D said
    Robin; \u201Cand as the new\r\nmoon is beginning to silver the leaves, I shall
    bear you company myself\r\nfor part of the way. \u2018Twas I who brought you
    into the wood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, I protest against your going needlessly
    far,\u201D said Sheriff.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I protest that I am loath to lose your
    company,\u201D replied Robin.\r\n\u201CThe next time I may not be so pleased.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    he took the Sheriff\u2019s horse by the bridle rein, and led him through\r\nthe
    lane and by many a thicket till the main road was reached.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow fare
    you well, good Sheriff,\u201D he said, \u201Cand when next you think to\r\ndespoil
    a poor prodigal, remember the herd you would have bought over\r\nagainst Gamewell.
    And when next you employ a servant, make certain that\r\nhe is not employing
    you.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying he smote the nag\u2019s haunch, and off went the
    Sheriff upon the\r\nroad to Nottingham.\r\n\r\nAnd that is how--you will find
    from many ballads that came to be sung\r\nat the Sheriff\u2019s expense, and
    which are known even to the present\r\nday--that, I say, is how the Sheriff lost
    three good servants and found\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHOW
    ROBIN HOOD MET WILL SCARLET\r\n\r\n     The youngster was clothed in scarlet
    red\r\n     In scarlet fine and gay;\r\n     And he did frisk it o\u2019er the
    plain,\r\n     And chanted a roundelay.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, soon after the
    proud Sheriff had been brought to\r\ngrief, Robin Hood and Little John went strolling
    down a path through the\r\nwood. It was not far from the foot--bridge where they
    had fought their\r\nmemorable battle; and by common impulse they directed their
    steps to\r\nthe brook to quench their thirst and rest them in the cool bushes.
    The\r\nmorning gave promise of a hot day. The road even by the brook was dusty.\r\nSo
    the cooling stream was very pleasing and grateful to their senses.\r\n\r\nOn
    each side of them, beyond the dusty highway, stretched out broad\r\nfields of
    tender young corn. On the yon side of the fields uprose the\r\nsturdy oaks and
    beeches and ashes of the forest; while at their feet\r\nmodest violets peeped
    out shyly and greeted the loiterers with an odor\r\nwhich made the heart glad.
    Over on the far side of the brook in a tiny\r\nbay floated three lily-pads; and
    from amid some clover blossoms on the\r\nbank an industrious bee rose with the
    hum of busy contentment. It was a\r\nday so brimful of quiet joy that the two
    friends lay flat on their\r\nbacks gazing up at the scurrying clouds, and neither
    caring to break the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nPresently they heard some one coming up
    the road whistling gaily, as\r\nthough he owned the whole world and \u2018twas
    but made to whistle in. Anon\r\nhe chanted a roundelay with a merry note.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    my troth, a gay bird!\u201D quoth Robin, raising up on his elbow. \u201CLet us\r\nlie
    still, and trust that his purse is not as light as his heart.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    they lay still, and in a minute more up came a smart stranger dressed\r\nin scarlet
    and silk and wearing a jaunty hat with a curling cock feather\r\nin it. His whole
    costume was of scarlet, from the feather to the silk\r\nhosen on his legs. A
    goodly sword hung at his side, its scabbard all\r\nembossed with tilting knights
    and weeping ladies. His hair was long and\r\nyellow and hung clustering about
    his shoulders, for all the world like a\r\nschoolgirl\u2019s; and he bore himself
    with as mincing a gait as the pertest\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nLittle John clucked
    his teeth drolly at this sight. \u201CBy my troth, a gay\r\nbird!\u201D he said
    echoing the other\u2019s words--then added, \u201CBut not so bad a\r\nbuild for
    all his prettiness. Look you, those calves and thighs are well\r\nrounded and
    straight. The arms, for all that gold-wrought cloak, hang\r\nstoutly from full
    shoulders. I warrant you the fop can use his dainty\r\nsword right well on occasion.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D
    retorted Robin, \u201Che is naught but a ladies\u2019 man from court. My\r\nlong-bow
    \u2018gainst a plugged shilling that he would run and bellow lustily\r\nat sight
    of a quarter-staff. Stay you behind this bush and I will soon\r\nget some rare
    sport out of him. Belike his silk purse may contain more\r\npennies than the
    law allows to one man in Sherwood or Barnesdale.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying Robin
    Hood stepped forth briskly from the covert and planted\r\nhimself in the way
    of the scarlet stranger. The latter had walked\r\nso slowly that he was scarce
    come to their resting-place; and now\r\non beholding Robin he neither slackened
    nor quickened his pace but\r\nsauntered idly straight ahead, looking to the right
    and to the left,\r\nwith the finest air in the world, but never once at Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold!\u201D
    quoth the outlaw. \u201CWhat mean ye by running thus over a wayfarer,\r\nrough
    shod?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWherefore should I hold, good fellow?\u201D said the
    stranger in a smooth\r\nvoice, and looking at Robin for the first time.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause
    I bid you to,\u201D replied Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd who may you be?\u201D asked
    the other as coolly as you please.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat my name is matters not,\u201D
    said Robin; \u201Cbut know that I am a public\r\ntax-gatherer and equalizer of
    shillings. If your purse have more than a\r\njust number of shillings or pence,
    I must e\u2019en lighten it somewhat; for\r\nthere are many worthy people round
    about these borders who have less\r\nthan the just amount. Wherefore, sweet gentleman,
    I pray you hand over\r\nyour purse without more ado, that I may judge of its
    weight in proper\r\nfashion.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other smiled as sweetly as though
    a lady were paying him a\r\ncompliment.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are a droll fellow,\u201D
    he said calmly. \u201CYour speech amuses me\r\nmightily. Pray continue, if you
    have not done, for I am in no hurry this\r\nmorning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have
    said all with my tongue that is needful,\u201D retorted Robin,\r\nbeginning to
    grow red under the collar. \u201CNathless, I have other\r\narguments which may
    not be so pleasing to your dainty skin. Prithee,\r\nstand and deliver. I promise
    to deal fairly with the purse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAlack-a-day!\u201D said the
    stranger with a little shrug of his shoulders;\r\n\u201CI am deeply sorrowful
    that I cannot show my purse to every rough lout\r\nthat asks to see it. But I
    really could not, as I have further need of\r\nit myself and every farthing it
    contains. Wherefore, pray stand aside.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay that will I not!
    and \u2018twill go the harder with you if you do not\r\nyield at once.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood
    fellow,\u201D said the other gently, \u201Chave I not heard all your speech\r\nwith
    patience? Now that is all I promised to do. My conscience is salved\r\nand I
    must go on my way. To-rol-o-rol-e-loo!\u201D he caroled, making as\r\nthough
    to depart.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold, I say!\u201D quoth Robin hotly; for he knew how
    Little John must be\r\nchuckling at this from behind the bushes. \u201CHold I
    say, else I shall have\r\nto bloody those fair locks of yours!\u201D And he swung
    his quarter-staff\r\nthreateningly.\r\n\r\n\u201CAlas!\u201D moaned the stranger
    shaking his head. \u201CThe pity of it all! Now I\r\nshall have to run this fellow
    through with my sword! And I hoped to be a\r\npeaceable man henceforth!\u201D
    And sighing deeply he drew his shining blade\r\nand stood on guard.\r\n\r\n\u201CPut
    by your weapon,\u201D said Robin. \u201CIt is too pretty a piece of steel to\r\nget
    cracked with common oak cudgel; and that is what would happen on\r\nthe first
    pass I made at you. Get you a stick like mine out of yon\r\nundergrowth, and
    we will fight fairly, man to man.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe stranger thought a moment
    with his usual slowness, and eyed Robin\r\nfrom head to foot. Then he unbuckled
    his scabbard, laid it and the sword\r\naside, and walked deliberately over to
    the oak thicket. Choosing from\r\namong the shoots and saplings he found a stout
    little tree to his\r\nliking, when he laid hold of it, without stopping to cut
    it, and gave a\r\ntug. Up it came root and all, as though it were a stalk of
    corn, and the\r\nstranger walked back trimming it as quietly as though pulling
    up trees\r\nwere the easiest thing in the world.\r\n\r\nLittle John from his
    hiding-place saw the feat, and could hardly\r\nrestrain a long whistle. \u201CBy
    our Lady!\u201D he muttered to himself, \u201CI would\r\nnot be in Master Robin\u2019s
    boots!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhatever Robin thought upon seeing the stranger\u2019s strength,
    he uttered\r\nnot a word and budged not an inch. He only put his oak staff at
    parry as\r\nthe other took his stand.\r\n\r\nThere was a threefold surprise that
    day, by the brookside. The stranger\r\nand Robin and Little John in the bushes
    all found a combat that upset\r\nall reckoning. The stranger for all his easy
    strength and cool nerve\r\nfound an antagonist who met his blows with the skill
    of a woodman. Robin\r\nfound the stranger as hard to hit as though fenced in
    by an oak hedge.\r\nWhile Little John rolled over and over in silent joy.\r\n\r\nBack
    and forth swayed the fighters, their cudgels pounding this way and\r\nthat, knocking
    off splinters and bark, and threatening direst damage to\r\nbone and muscle and
    skin. Back and forth they pranced kicking up a cloud\r\nof dust and gasping for
    fresh air. From a little way off you would have\r\nvowed that these two men were
    trying to put out a fire, so thickly\r\nhung the cloud of battle over them. Thrice
    did Robin smite the scarlet\r\nman--with such blows that a less stout fellow
    must have bowled over.\r\nOnly twice did the scarlet man smite Robin, but the
    second blow was\r\nlike to finish him. The first had been delivered over the
    knuckles, and\r\nthough \u2018twas a glancing stroke it well nigh broke Robin\u2019s
    fingers, so\r\nthat he could not easily raise his staff again. And while he was
    dancing\r\nabout in pain and muttering a dust-covered oath, the other\u2019s
    staff came\r\nswinging through the cloud at one side--zip!--and struck him under
    the\r\narm. Down went Robin as though he were a nine-pin--flat down into the\r\ndust
    of the road. But despite the pain he was bounding up again like an\r\nIndia rubber
    man to renew the attack, when Little John interfered.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold!\u201D
    said he, bursting out of the bushes and seizing the stranger\u2019s\r\nweapon.
    \u201CHold, I say!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D retorted the stranger quietly,
    \u201CI was not offering to smite him\r\nwhile he was down. But if there be a
    whole nest of you hatching here by\r\nthe waterside, cluck out the other chicks
    and I\u2019ll make shift to fight\r\nthem all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot for all
    the deer in Sherwood!\u201D cried Robin. \u201CYou are a good fellow\r\nand a
    gentleman. I\u2019ll fight no more with you, for verily I feel sore in\r\nwrist
    and body. Nor shall any of mine molest you henceforth.\u201D\r\n\r\nSooth to
    say, Robin did not look in good fighting trim. His clothes were\r\ncoated with
    dirt, one of his hosen had slipped halfway down from his\r\nknee, the sleeve
    of his jerkin was split, and his face was streaked with\r\nsweat and dirt. Little
    John eyed him drolly.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow now, good master,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cthe
    sport you were to kick up has\r\nleft you in sorry plight. Let me dust your coat
    for you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry, it has been dusted enough already,\u201D replied
    Robin; \u201Cand I now\r\nbelieve the Scripture saying that all men are but dust,
    for it has\r\nsifted me through and through and lined my gullet an inch deep.
    By your\r\nleave\u201D--and he went to the brookside and drank deep and laved
    his face\r\nand hands.\r\n\r\nAll this while the stranger had been eyeing Robin
    attentively and\r\nlistening to his voice as though striving to recall it.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf
    I mistake not,\u201D he said slowly at last, \u201Cyou are that famous outlaw,\r\nRobin
    Hood of Barnesdale.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou say right,\u201D replied Robin; \u201Cbut
    my fame has been tumbling sadly\r\nabout in the dust to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow
    why did I not know you at once?\u201D continued the stranger. \u201CThis\r\nbattle
    need not have happened, for I came abroad to find you to-day, and\r\nthought
    to have remembered your face and speech. Know you not me, Rob,\r\nmy lad? Hast
    ever been to Gamewell Lodge?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHa! Will Gamewell! my dear old
    chum, Will Gamewell!\u201D shouted Robin,\r\nthrowing his arms about the other
    in sheer affection. \u201CWhat an ass I was\r\nnot to recognize you! But it has
    been years since we parted, and your\r\ngentle schooling has polished you off
    mightily.\u201D\r\n\r\nWill embraced his cousin no less heartily.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    are quits on not knowing kinsmen,\u201D he said, \u201Cfor you have changed\r\nand
    strengthened much from the stripling with whom I used to run foot\r\nraces in
    old Sherwood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut why seek you me?\u201D asked Robin. \u201CYou
    know I am an outlaw and\r\ndangerous company. And how left you mine uncle? and
    have you heard aught\r\nof late of--of Maid Marian?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour last
    question first,\u201D answered Will, laughing, \u201Cfor I perceive\r\nthat it
    lies nearest your heart. I saw Maid Marian not many weeks after\r\nthe great
    shooting at Nottingham, when you won her the golden arrow. She\r\nprizes the
    bauble among her dearest possessions, though it has made her\r\nan enemy in the
    Sheriff\u2019s proud daughter. Maid Marian bade me tell you,\r\nif I ever saw
    you, that she must return to Queen Eleanor\u2019s court, but\r\nshe could never
    forget the happy days in the greenwood. As for the old\r\nSquire, he is still
    hale and hearty, though rheumatic withal. He speaks\r\nof you as a sad young
    dog, but for all that is secretly proud of your\r\nskill at the bow and of the
    way you are pestering the Sheriff, whom\r\nhe likes not. \u2018Twas for my father\u2019s
    sake that I am now in the open, an\r\noutlaw like yourself. He has had a steward,
    a surly fellow enough, who,\r\nwhile I was away at school, boot-licked his way
    to favor until he lorded\r\nit over the whole house. Then he grew right saucy
    and impudent, but my\r\nfather minded it not, deeming the fellow indispensable
    in managing the\r\nestate. But when I came back it irked me sorely to see the
    fellow strut\r\nabout as though he owned the place. He was sly enough with me
    at first,\r\nand would brow-beat the Squire only while I was out of earshot.
    It\r\nchanced one day, however, that I heard loud voices through an open\r\nwindow
    and paused to hearken. That vile servant called my father \u2018a\r\nmeddling
    old fool,\u2019 \u2018Fool and meddler art thou thyself, varlet,\u2019 I\r\nshouted,
    springing through the window, \u2018_that_ for thy impudence!\u2019 and\r\nin
    my heat I smote him a blow mightier than I intended, for I have\r\nsome strength
    in mine arm. The fellow rolled over and never breathed\r\nafterwards, I think
    I broke his neck or something the like. Then I knew\r\nthat the Sheriff would
    use this as a pretext to hound my father, if I\r\ntarried. So I bade the Squire
    farewell and told him I would seek you in\r\nSherwood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow
    by my halidom!\u201D said Robin Hood; \u201Cfor a man escaping the law, you\r\ntook
    it about as coolly as one could wish. To see you come tripping\r\nalong decked
    out in all your gay plumage and trolling forth a roundelay,\r\none would think
    you had not a care in all the world. Indeed I remarked\r\nto Little John here
    that I hoped your purse was not as light as your\r\nheart.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBelike
    you meant _head_,\u201D laughed Will; \u201Cand is this Little John the\r\nGreat?
    Shake hands with me, an you will, and promise me to cross a staff\r\nwith me
    in friendly bout some day in the forest!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I!\u201D
    quoth Little John heartily. \u201CHere\u2019s my hand on it. What\r\nis your
    last name again, say you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis to be changed,\u201D interposed
    Robin; \u201Cthen shall the men armed with\r\nwarrants go hang for all of us.
    Let me bethink myself. Ah!--I have it!\r\nIn scarlet he came to us, and that
    shall be his name henceforth. Welcome\r\nto the greenwood, Will Scarlet!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    welcome, Will Scarlet!\u201D said Little John; and they all clasped\r\nhands
    again and swore to be true each to the other and to Robin Hood\u2019s\r\nmen
    in Sherwood Forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET
    FRIAR TUCK\r\n\r\n     The friar took Robin Hood on his back,\r\n     Deep water
    he did bestride,\r\n     And spake neither good word nor bad,\r\n     Till he
    came at the other side.\r\n\r\nIn summer time when leaves grow green, and flowers
    are fresh and gay,\r\nRobin Hood and his merry men were all disposed to play.
    Thus runs a\r\nquaint old ballad which begins the next adventure. Then some would
    leap\r\nand some would run and some try archery and some ply the quarter-staff\r\nand
    some fall to with the good broad sword. Some again would try a round\r\nat buffet
    and fisticuff; and thus by every variety of sport and exercise\r\nthey perfected
    themselves in skill and made the band and its prowess\r\nwell known throughout
    all England.\r\n\r\nIt had been a custom of Robin Hood\u2019s to pick out the
    best men in all the\r\ncountryside. Whenever he heard of one more than usually
    skilled in\r\nany feat of arms he would seek the man and test him in personal\r\nencounter--which
    did not always end happily for Robin. And when he had\r\nfound a man to his liking
    he offered him service with the bold fellows\r\nof Sherwood Forest.\r\n\r\nThus
    it came about that one day after a practice at shooting, in which\r\nLittle John
    struck down a hart at five hundred feet distance, Robin Hood\r\nwas fain to boast.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod\u2019s
    blessing on your heart!\u201D he cried, clapping the burly fellow on\r\nthe shoulder;
    \u201CI would travel an hundred miles to find one who could\r\nmatch you!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt
    this Will Scarlet laughed full roundly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere lives a curtall friar
    in Fountain\u2019s Abbey--Tuck, by name--who can\r\nbeat both him and you,\u201D
    he said.\r\n\r\nRobin pricked up his ears at this free speech.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    our Lady,\u201D he said, \u201CI\u2019ll neither eat nor drink till I see this
    same\r\nfriar.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with his usual impetuosity he at once set about
    arming himself for\r\nthe adventure. On his head he placed a cap of steel. Underneath
    his\r\nLincoln green he wore a coat of chain metal. Then with sword and buckler\r\ngirded
    at his side he made a goodly show. But he also took with him his\r\nstout yew
    bow and a sheaf of chosen arrows.\r\n\r\nSo he set forth upon his way with blithe
    heart; for it was a day when\r\nthe whole face of the earth seemed glad and rejoicing
    in pulsing life.\r\nSteadily he pressed forward by winding ways till he came
    to a green\r\nbroad pasture land at whose edge flowed a stream dipping in and
    out\r\namong the willows and rushes on the banks. A pleasant stream it was, but\r\nit
    flowed calmly as though of some depth in the middle. Robin did not\r\nfancy getting
    his feet wet, or his fine suit of mail rusted, so he\r\npaused on the hither
    bank to rest and take his bearings.\r\n\r\nAs he sat down quietly under the shade
    of a drooping willow he heard\r\nsnatches of a jovial song floating to him from
    the farther side; then\r\ncame a sound of two men\u2019s voices arguing. One
    was upholding the\r\nmerits of hasty pudding and the other stood out stoutly
    for meat pie,\r\n\u201Cespecially\u201D--quoth this one--\u201Cwhen flavored
    with young onions!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGramercy!\u201D muttered Robin to himself,
    \u201Cthat is a tantalizing speech to\r\na hungry man! But, odds bodikins! did
    ever two men talk more alike than\r\nthose two fellows yonder!\u201D\r\n\r\nIn
    truth Robin could well marvel at the speech, for the voices were\r\ncuriously
    alike.\r\n\r\nPresently the willows parted on the other bank, and Robin could
    hardly\r\nforebear laughing out right. His mystery was explained. It was not
    two\r\nmen who had done all this singing and talking, but one--and that one a\r\nstout
    curtall friar who wore a long cloak over his portly frame, tied\r\nwith a cord
    in the middle. On his head was a knight\u2019s helmet, and in his\r\nhand was
    a no more warlike weapon than a huge pasty pie, with which he\r\nsat down by
    the water\u2019s edge. His twofold argument was finished. The\r\nmeat pie had
    triumphed; and no wonder! for it was the present witness,\r\nsoon to give its
    own testimony.\r\n\r\nBut first the friar took off his helmet to cool his head,
    and a droll\r\npicture he made. His head was as round as an apple, and eke as
    smooth in\r\nspots. A fringe of close curling black hair grew round the base
    of his\r\nskull, but his crown was bare and shiny as an egg. His cheeks also
    were\r\nsmooth and red and shiny; and his little gray eyes danced about with\r\nthe
    funniest air imaginable. You would not have blamed Robin Hood for\r\nwanting
    to laugh, had you heard this serious two-faced talk and then\r\nseen this jovial
    one-faced man. Good humor and fat living stood out all\r\nover him; yet for all
    that he looked stout enough and able to take\r\ncare of himself with any man.
    His short neck was thick like that of a\r\nBerkshire bull; his shoulders were
    set far back, and his arms sprouted\r\ntherefrom like two oak limbs. As he sat
    him down, the cloak fell apart\r\ndisclosing a sword and buckler as stout as
    Robin\u2019s own.\r\n\r\nNathless, Robin was not dismayed at sight of the weapons.
    Instead, his\r\nheart fell within him when he saw the meat pie which was now
    in fair\r\nway to be devoured before his very eyes; for the friar lost no time
    in\r\nthrusting one hand deep into the pie, while he crossed himself with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThereupon
    Robin seized his bow and fitted a shaft.\r\n\r\n\u201CHey, friar!\u201D he sang
    out, \u201Ccarry me over the water, or else I cannot\r\nanswer for your safety.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    other started at the unexpected greeting, and laid his hand upon\r\nhis sword.
    Then he looked up and beheld Robin\u2019s arrow pointing full upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\u201CPut
    down your bow, fellow,\u201D he shouted back, \u201Cand I will bring you over\r\nthe
    brook. \u2018Tis our duty in life to help each other, and your keen shaft\r\nshows
    me that you are a man worthy of some attention.\u201D So the friar\r\nknight
    got him up gravely, though his eyes twinkled with a cunning\r\nlight, and laid
    aside his beloved pie and his cloak and his sword and\r\nhis buckler, and waded
    across the stream with waddling dignity. Then he\r\ntook Robin Hood upon his
    back and spoke neither good word nor bad till\r\nhe came to the other side.\r\n\r\nLightly
    leaped Robin off his back, and said, \u201CI am much beholden to you,\r\ngood
    father.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBeholden, say you!\u201D rejoined the other drawing
    his sword; \u201Cthen by my\r\nfaith you shall e\u2019en repay your score. Now
    mine own affairs, which are\r\nof a spiritual kind and much more important than
    yours which are carnal,\r\nlie on the other side of this stream. I see that you
    are a likely man\r\nand one, moreover, who would not refuse to serve the church.
    I must\r\ntherefore pray of you that whatsoever I have done unto you, you will
    do\r\nalso unto me. In short, my son, you must e\u2019en carry me back again.\u201D\r\n\r\nCourteously
    enough was this said; but so suddenly had the friar drawn\r\nhis sword that Robin
    had no time to unsling his bow from his back,\r\nwhither he had placed it to
    avoid getting it wet, or to unfasten his\r\nscabbard. So he was fain to temporize.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    good father, but I shall get my feet wet,\u201D he commenced.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre
    your feet any better than mine?\u201D retorted the other. \u201CI fear me\r\nnow
    that I have already wetted myself so sadly as to lay in a store of\r\nrheumatic
    pains by way of penance.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not so strong as you,\u201D
    continued Robin; \u201Cthat helmet and sword and\r\nbuckler would be my undoing
    on the uncertain footing amidstream, to say\r\nnothing of your holy flesh and
    bones.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen I will lighten up, somewhat,\u201D replied the
    other calmly. \u201CPromise\r\nto carry me across and I will lay aside my war
    gear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAgreed,\u201D said Robin; and the friar thereupon stripped
    himself; and\r\nRobin bent his stout back and took him up even as he had promised.\r\n\r\nNow
    the stones at the bottom of the stream were round and slippery, and\r\nthe current
    swept along strongly, waist-deep, in the middle. More-over\r\nRobin had a heavier
    load than the other had borne, nor did he know the\r\nford. So he went stumbling
    along now stepping into a deep hole, now\r\nstumbling over a boulder in a manner
    that threatened to unseat his rider\r\nor plunge them both clear under current.
    But the fat friar hung on and\r\ndug his heels into his steed\u2019s ribs in
    as gallant manner as if he were\r\nriding in a tournament; while as for poor
    Robin the sweat ran down him\r\nin torrents and he gasped like the winded horse
    he was. But at last he\r\nmanaged to stagger out on the bank and deposit his
    unwieldy load.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he set the friar down than he seized his
    own sword.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, holy friar,\u201D quoth he, panting and wiping the
    sweat from his brow,\r\n\u201Cwhat say the Scriptures that you quote so glibly?--Be
    not weary of\r\nwell doing. You must carry me back again or I swear that I will
    make a\r\ncheese-cloth out of your jacket!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe friar\u2019s gray
    eyes once more twinkled with a cunning gleam that boded\r\nno good to Robin;
    but his voice was as calm and courteous as ever.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour wits are keen,
    my son,\u201D he said; \u201Cand I see that the waters of the\r\nstream have
    not quenched your spirit. Once more will I bend my back to\r\nthe oppressor and
    carry the weight of the haughty.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Robin mounted again in high
    glee, and carried his sword in his\r\nhand, and went prepared to tarry upon the
    other side. But while he\r\nwas bethinking himself what great words to use, when
    he should arrive\r\nthither, he felt himself slipping from the friar\u2019s broad
    back. He\r\nclutched frantically to save himself but had too round a surface
    to\r\ngrasp, besides being hampered by his weapon. So down went he with a\r\nloud
    splash into the middle of the stream, where the crafty friar had\r\nconveyed
    him.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere!\u201D quoth the holy man; \u201Cchoose you, choose you,
    my fine fellow,\r\nwhether you will sink or swim!\u201D And he gained his own
    bank without more\r\nado, while Robin thrashed and spluttered about until he
    made shift to\r\ngrasp a willow wand and thus haul himself ashore on the other
    side.\r\n\r\nThen Robin\u2019s rage waxed furious, despite his wetting, and he
    took his\r\nbow and his arrows and let fly one shaft after another at the worthy\r\nfriar.
    But they rattled harmlessly off his steel buckler, while he\r\nlaughed and minded
    them no more than if they had been hail-stones.\r\n\r\n\u201CShoot on, shoot
    on, good fellow,\u201D he sang out; \u201Cshoot as you have\r\nbegun; if you
    shoot here a summer\u2019s day, your mark I will not shun!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Robin
    shot, and passing well, till all his arrows were gone, when\r\nfrom very rage
    he began to revile him.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou bloody villain!\u201D shouted he, \u201CYou
    psalm-singing hypocrite! You\r\nreviler of good hasty pudding! Come but within
    reach of my sword\r\narm, and, friar or no friar, I\u2019ll shave your tonsure
    closer than ever\r\nbald-pated monk was shaven before!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSoft
    you and fair!\u201D said the friar unconcernedly; \u201Chard words are\r\ncheap,
    and you may need your wind presently. An you would like a bout\r\nwith swords,
    meet me halfway i\u2019 the stream.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with this speech the friar
    waded into the brook, sword in hand,\r\nwhere he was met halfway by the impetuous
    outlaw.\r\n\r\nThereupon began a fierce and mighty battle. Up and down, in and
    out,\r\nback and forth they fought. The swords flashed in the rays of the\r\ndeclining
    sun and then met with a clash that would have shivered less\r\nsturdy weapons
    or disarmed less sturdy wielders. Many a smart blow was\r\nlanded, but each perceived
    that the other wore an undercoat of linked\r\nmail which might not be pierced.
    Nathless, their ribs ached at the force\r\nof the blows. Once and again they
    paused by mutual consent and caught\r\nbreath and looked hard each at the other;
    for never had either met so\r\nstout a fellow.\r\n\r\nFinally in a furious onset
    of lunge and parry Robin\u2019s foot stepped on a\r\nrolling stone, and he went
    down upon his knees. But his antagonist would\r\nnot take this advantage: he
    paused until Robin should get upon his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by our Lady!\u201D
    cried the outlaw, using his favorite oath, \u201Cyou are\r\nthe fairest swordsman
    that I have met in many a long day. I would beg a\r\nboon of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    is it?\u201D said the other.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me leave to set my horn to my
    mouth and blow three blasts\r\nthereon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I do,\u201D
    said the curtall friar, \u201Cblow till your breath fails,\r\nan it please you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen,
    says the old ballad, Robin Hood set his horn to mouth and blew\r\nmighty blasts;
    and half a hundred yeomen, bows bent, came raking over\r\nthe lee.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhose
    men are these,\u201D said the friar, \u201Cthat come so hastily?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThese
    men are mine,\u201D said Robin Hood, feeling that his time to laugh\r\nwas come
    at last.\r\n\r\nThen said the friar in his turn, \u201CA boon, a boon, the like
    I gave to\r\nyou. Give me leave to set my fist to my mouth and whistle three
    blasts\r\nthereon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I do,\u201D said Robin, \u201Cor
    else I were lacking in courtesy.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe friar set his fist to his mouth
    and put the horn to shame by the\r\npiercing whistles he blew; whereupon half
    a hundred great dogs came\r\nrunning and jumping so swiftly that they had reached
    their bank as soon\r\nas Robin Hood\u2019s men had reached his side.\r\n\r\nThen
    followed a rare foolish conflict. Stutely, Much, Little John\r\nand the other
    outlaws began sending their arrows whizzing toward the\r\nopposite bank; but
    the dogs, which were taught of the friar, dodged the\r\nmissiles cleverly and
    ran and fetched them back again, just as the dogs\r\nof to-day catch sticks.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have never seen the like of this in my days!\u201D cried Little John,\r\namazed.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis
    rank sorcery and witchcraft.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake off your dogs, Friar Tuck!\u201D
    shouted Will Scarlet, who had but then\r\nrun up, and who now stood laughing
    heartily at the scene.\r\n\r\n\u201CFriar Tuck!\u201D exclaimed Robin, astounded.
    \u201CAre you Friar Tuck? Then am I\r\nyour friend, for you are he I came to
    seek.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am but a poor anchorite, a curtall friar,\u201D said
    the other, whistling\r\nto his pack, \u201Cby name Friar Tuck of Fountain\u2019s
    Dale. For seven years\r\nhave I tended the Abbey here, preached o\u2019 Sundays,
    and married and\r\nchristened and buried folk--and fought too, if need were;
    and if it\r\nsmacks not too much of boasting, I have not yet met the knight or\r\ntrooper
    or yeoman that I would yield before. But yours is a stout blade.\r\nI would fain
    know you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis Robin Hood, the outlaw, who has been assisting
    you at this\r\nchristening,\u201D said Will Scarlet glancing roguishly at the
    two opponents\u2019\r\ndripping garments. And at this sally the whole bad burst
    into a shout of\r\nlaughter, in which Robin and Friar Tuck joined.\r\n\r\n\u201CRobin
    Hood!\u201D cried the good friar presently, holding his sides; \u201Care\r\nyou
    indeed that famous yeoman? Then I like you well; and had I known you\r\nearlier,
    would have both carried you across and shared my pasty pie with\r\nyou.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo
    speak soothly,\u201D replied Robin gaily, \u201C\u2018twas that same pie that
    led\r\nme to be rude. Now, therefore, bring it and your dogs and repair with
    us\r\nto the greenwood. We have need of you--with this message came I to-day\r\nto
    seek you. We will build you a hermitage in Sherwood Forest, and you\r\nshall
    keep us from evil ways. Will you not join our band?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry,
    that will I!\u201D cried Friar Tuck jovially. \u201COnce more will I cross\r\nthis
    much beforded stream, and go with you to the good greenwood!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    VIII\r\n\r\nHOW ALLAN-A-DALE\u2019S WOOING WAS PROSPERED\r\n\r\n     \u201CWhat
    is thy name?\u201D then said Robin Hood,\r\n     \u201CCome tell me, without
    any fail!\u201D\r\n      \u201CBy the faith o\u2019 my body,\u201D then said
    the young man,\r\n     \u201CMy name it is Allan-a-Dale.\u201D\r\n\r\nFriar Tuck
    and Much the miller\u2019s son soon became right good friends over\r\nthe steaming
    stew they jointly prepared for the merry men that evening.\r\nTuck was mightily
    pleased when he found a man in the forest who could\r\nmake pasties and who had
    cooked for no less person than the High Sheriff\r\nhimself. While Much marveled
    at the friar\u2019s knowledge of herbs and\r\nsimples and woodland things which
    savored a stew greatly. So they\r\ngabbled together like two old gossips and,
    between them, made such a\r\ntasty mess that Robin Hood and his stout followers
    were like never to\r\nleave off eating. And the friar said grace too, with great
    unction, over\r\nthe food; and Robin said Amen! and that henceforth they were
    always to\r\nhave mass of Sundays.\r\n\r\nSo Robin walked forth into the wood
    that evening with his stomach full\r\nand his heart, therefore, in great contentment
    and love for other men.\r\nHe did not stop the first passer-by, as his manner
    often was, and desire\r\na fight. Instead, he stepped behind a tree, when he
    heard a man\u2019s voice\r\nin song, and waited to behold the singer. Perhaps
    he remembered, also,\r\nthe merry chanting of Will Scarlet, and how he had tried
    to give it\r\npause a few days before.\r\n\r\nLike Will, this fellow was clad
    in scarlet, though he did not look quite\r\nas fine a gentleman. Nathless, he
    was a sturdy yeoman of honest face and\r\na voice far sweeter than Will\u2019s.
    He seemed to be a strolling minstrel,\r\nfor he bore a harp in his hand, which
    he thrummed, while his lusty tenor\r\nvoice rang out with--\r\n\r\n     \u201CHey
    down, and a down, and a down!\r\n     I\u2019ve a lassie back i\u2019 the town;\r\n    
    Come day, come night, Come dark or light,\r\n     She will wed me, back i\u2019
    the town!\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin let the singer pass, caroling on his way.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis
    not in me to disturb a light-hearted lover, this night,\u201D he\r\nmuttered,
    a memory of Marian coming back to him. \u201CPray heaven she may be\r\ntrue to
    him and the wedding be a gay one \u2018back i\u2019 the town!\u201D\u2019\r\n\r\nSo
    Robin went back to his camp, where he told of the minstrel.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf any
    of ye set on him after this,\u201D quoth he in ending, \u201Cbring him to\r\nme,
    for I would have speech with him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe very next day his wish was
    gratified. Little John and Much the\r\nmiller\u2019s son were out together on
    a foraging expedition when they espied\r\nthe same young man; at least, they
    thought it must be he, for he was\r\nclad in scarlet and carried a harp in his
    hand. But now he came drooping\r\nalong the way; his scarlet was all in tatters;
    and at every step he\r\nfetched a sigh, \u201CAlack and a well-a-day!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    stepped forth Little John and Much the miller\u2019s son.\r\n\r\n\u201CHo! do
    not wet the earth with your weeping,\u201D said Little John, \u201Celse we\r\nshall
    all have lumbago.\u201D\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the young man catch sight of them
    than he bent his bow,\r\nand held an arrow back to his ear.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand
    off! stand off!\u201D he said; \u201Cwhat is your will with me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPut
    by your weapon,\u201D said Much, \u201Cwe will not harm you. But you must\r\ncome
    before our master straight, under yon greenwood tree.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the minstrel
    put by his bow and suffered himself to be led before\r\nRobin Hood.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow
    now!\u201D quoth Robin, when he beheld his sorry countenance, \u201Care you\r\nnot
    he whom I heard no longer ago than yesternight caroling so blithely\r\nabout
    \u2018a lassie back i\u2019 the town\u2019?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe same in body,
    good sir,\u201D replied the other sadly; \u201Cbut my spirit is\r\ngrievously
    changed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell me your tale,\u201D said Robin courteously.
    \u201CBelike I can help you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat can no man on earth, I fear,\u201D
    said the stranger; \u201Cnathless, I\u2019ll\r\ntell you the tale. Yesterday
    I stood pledged to a maid, and thought\r\nsoon to wed her. But she has been taken
    from me and is to become an\r\nold knight\u2019s bride this very day; and as
    for me, I care not what ending\r\ncomes to my days, or how soon, without her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry,
    come up!\u201D said Robin; \u201Chow got the old knight so sudden\r\nvantage?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLook
    you, worship, \u2018tis this way. The Normans overrun us, and are in\r\nsuch
    great favor that none may say them nay. This old returned Crusader\r\ncoveted
    the land whereon my lady dwells. The estate is not large, but\r\nall in her own
    right; whereupon her brother says she shall wed a title,\r\nand he and the old
    knight have fixed it up for to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, but surely--\u201D
    began Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CHear me out, worship,\u201D said the other. \u201CBelike
    you think me a sorry\r\ndog not to make fight of this. But the old knight, look
    you, is not\r\ncome-at-able. I threw one of his varlets into a thorn hedge, and
    another\r\ninto a water-butt, and a third landed head-first into a ditch. But
    I\r\ncouldn\u2019t do any fighting at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis a pity!\u201D
    quoth Little John gravely. He had been sitting\r\ncross-legged listening to this
    tale of woe. \u201CWhat think you, Friar Tuck,\r\ndoth not a bit of fighting
    ease a man\u2019s mind?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBlood-letting is ofttimes recommended
    of the leeches,\u201D replied Tuck.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes the maid love you?\u201D
    asked Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy our troth, she loved me right well,\u201D said
    the minstrel. \u201CI have a\r\nlittle ring of hers by me which I have kept for
    seven long years.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is your name?\u201D then said Robin
    Hood.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy the faith of my body,\u201D replied the young man, \u201Cmy
    name is\r\nAllan-a-Dale.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat will you give me, Allan-a-Dale,\u201D
    said Robin Hood, \u201Cin ready gold\r\nor fee, to help you to your true love
    again, and deliver her back unto\r\nyou?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have no money,
    save only five shillings,\u201D quoth Allan; \u201Cbut--are you\r\nnot Robin
    Hood?\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin nodded.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you, if any one, can aid me!\u201D
    said Allan-a-Dale eagerly. \u201CAnd if\r\nyou give me back my love, I swear
    upon the Book that I will be your true\r\nservant forever after.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere
    is this wedding to take place, and when?\u201D asked Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt Plympton
    Church, scarce five miles from here; and at three o\u2019 the\r\nafternoon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen
    to Plympton we will go!\u201D cried Robin suddenly springing into\r\naction;
    and he gave out orders like a general: \u201CWill Stutely, do you\r\nhave four-and-twenty
    good men over against Plympton Church \u2018gainst three\r\no\u2019 the afternoon.
    Much, good fellow, do you cook up some porridge for\r\nthis youth, for he must
    have a good round stomach--aye, and a better\r\ngear! Will Scarlet, you will
    see to decking him out bravely for the\r\nnonce. And Friar Tuck, hold yourself
    in readiness, good book in hand, at\r\nthe church. Mayhap you had best go ahead
    of us all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe fat Bishop of Hereford was full of pomp and importance
    that day at\r\nPlympton Church. He was to celebrate the marriage of an old knight--a\r\nreturned
    Crusader--and a landed young woman; and all the gentry\r\nthereabout were to
    grace the occasion with their presence. The church\r\nitself was gaily festooned
    with flowers for the ceremony, while out\r\nin the church-yard at one side brown
    ale flowed freely for all the\r\nservitors.\r\n\r\nAlready were the guests beginning
    to assemble, when the Bishop, back in\r\nthe vestry, saw a minstrel clad in green
    walk up boldly to the door and\r\npeer within. It was Robin Hood, who had borrowed
    Allan\u2019s be-ribboned\r\nharp for the time.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow who are you,
    fellow?\u201D quoth the Bishop, \u201Cand what do you here at\r\nthe church-door
    with you harp and saucy air?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMay it please your Reverence,\u201D
    returned Robin bowing very humbly, \u201CI\r\nam but a strolling harper, yet
    likened the best in the whole North\r\nCountree. And I had hope that my thrumming
    might add zest to the wedding\r\nto-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat tune can you
    harp?\u201D demanded the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can harp a tune so merry that
    a forlorn lover will forget he is\r\njilted,\u201D said Robin. \u201CI can harp
    another tune that will make a bride\r\nforsake her lord at the altar. I can harp
    another tune that will bring\r\nloving souls together though they were up hill
    and down dale five good\r\nmiles away from each other.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen
    welcome, good minstrel,\u201D said the Bishop, \u201Cmusic pleases me right\r\nwell,
    and if you can play up to your prattle, \u2018twill indeed grace your\r\nceremony.
    Let us have a sample of your wares.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, I must not put finger
    to string until the bride and groom have\r\ncome. Such a thing would ill fortune
    both us and them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave it as you will,\u201D said the Bishop,
    \u201Cbut here comes the party now.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen up the lane to the church
    came the old knight, preceded by ten\r\narchers liveried in scarlet and gold.
    A brave sight the archers made,\r\nbut their master walked slowly leaning upon
    a cane and shaking as though\r\nin a palsy.\r\n\r\nAnd after them came a sweet
    lass leaning upon her brother\u2019s arm. Her\r\nhair did shine like glistering
    gold, and her eyes were like blue violets\r\nthat peep out shyly at the sun.
    The color came and went in her cheeks\r\nlike that tinting of a sea-shell, and
    her face was flushed as though\r\nshe had been weeping. But now she walked with
    a proud air, as though she\r\ndefied the world to crush her spirit. She had but
    two maids with her,\r\nfinikin lasses, with black eyes and broad bosoms, who
    set off their\r\nlady\u2019s more delicate beauty well. One held up the bride\u2019s
    gown from the\r\nground; the other carried flowers in plenty.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow
    by all the wedding bells that ever were rung!\u201D quoth Robin boldly,\r\n\u201Cthis
    is the worst matched pair that ever mine eyes beheld!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSilence,
    miscreant!\u201D said a man who stood near.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had hurriedly donned
    his gown and now stood ready to meet the\r\ncouple at the chancel.\r\n\r\nBut
    Robin paid no heed to him. He let the knight and his ten archers\r\npass by,
    then he strode up to the bride, and placed himself on the other\r\nside from
    her brother.\r\n\r\n\u201CCourage, lady!\u201D he whispered, \u201Cthere is another
    minstrel near, who\r\nmayhap may play more to your liking.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe lady
    glanced at him with a frightened air, but read such honesty and\r\nkindness in
    his glance that she brightened and gave him a grateful look.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand
    aside, fool!\u201D cried the brother wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, but I am to
    bring good fortune to the bride by accompanying her\r\nthrough the church-doors,\u201D
    said Robin laughing.\r\n\r\nThereupon he was allowed to walk by her side unmolested,
    up to the\r\nchancel with the party.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow strike up your music, fellow!\u201D
    ordered the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\u201CRight gladly will I,\u201D quoth Robin, \u201Can
    you will let me choose my\r\ninstrument. For sometimes I like the harp, and other
    times I think the\r\nhorn makes the merriest music in all the world.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    he drew forth his bugle from underneath his green cloak and blew\r\nthree winding
    notes that made the church--rafters ring again.\r\n\r\n\u201CSeize him!\u201D
    yelled the Bishop; \u201Cthere\u2019s mischief afoot! These are the\r\ntricks
    of Robin Hood!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe ten liveried archers rushed forward from the
    rear of the church,\r\nwhere they had been stationed. But their rush was blocked
    by the\r\nonlookers who now rose from their pews in alarm and crowded the aisles.\r\nMeanwhile
    Robin had leaped lightly over the chancel rail and stationed\r\nhimself in a
    nook by the altar.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand where you are!\u201D he shouted, drawing
    his bow, \u201Cthe first man to\r\npass the rail dies the death. And all ye who
    have come to witness a\r\nwedding stay in your seats. We shall e\u2019en have
    one, since we are come\r\ninto the church. But the bride shall choose her own
    swain!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen up rose another great commotion at the door, and four-and-twenty\r\ngood
    bowmen came marching in with Will Stutely at their head. And they\r\nseized the
    ten liveried archers and the bride\u2019s scowling brother and the\r\nother men
    on guard and bound them prisoners.\r\n\r\nThen in came Allan-a-Dale, decked out
    gaily, with Will Scarlet for best\r\nman. And they walked gravely down the aisle
    and stood over against the\r\nchancel.\r\n\r\n\u201CBefore a maiden weds she
    chooses--an the laws of good King Harry be\r\njust ones,\u201D said Robin. \u201CNow,
    maiden, before this wedding continues,\r\nwhom will you have to husband?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    maiden answered not in words, but smiled with a glad light in her\r\neyes, and
    walked over to Allan and clasped her arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is
    her true love,\u201D said Robin. \u201CYoung Allan instead of the gouty\r\nknight.
    And the true lovers shall be married at this time before we\r\ndepart away. Now
    my lord Bishop, proceed with the ceremony!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, that shall
    not be,\u201D protested the Bishop; \u201Cthe banns must be cried\r\nthree times
    in the church. Such is the law of our land.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome here, Little
    John,\u201D called Robin impatiently; and plucked off the\r\nBishop\u2019s frock
    from his back and put it on the yeoman.\r\n\r\nNow the Bishop was short and fat,
    and Little John was long and lean.\r\nThe gown hung loosely over Little John\u2019s
    shoulders and came only to\r\nhis waist. He was a fine comical sight, and the
    people began to laugh\r\nconsumedly at him.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy the faith o\u2019
    my body,\u201D said Robin, \u201Cthis cloth makes you a man.\r\nYou\u2019re the
    finest Bishop that ever I saw in my life. Now cry the banns.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    Little John clambered awkwardly into the quire, his short gown\r\nfluttering
    gaily; and he called the banns for the marriage of the maid\r\nand Allan-a-Dale
    once, twice, and thrice.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not enough,\u201D said Robin;
    \u201Cyour gown is so short that you must\r\ntalk longer.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Little
    John asked them in the church four, five, six, and seven\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood
    enough!\u201D said Robin. \u201CNow belike I see a worthy friar in the back\r\nof
    this church who can say a better service than ever my lord Bishop of\r\nHereford.
    My lord Bishop shall be witness and seal the papers, but do\r\nyou, good friar,
    bless this pair with book and candle.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Friar Tuck, who all along
    had been back in one corner of the church,\r\ncame forward; and Allan and his
    maid kneeled before him, while the old\r\nknight, held an unwilling witness,
    gnashed his teeth in impotent rage;\r\nand the friar began with the ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen
    he asked, \u201CWho giveth this woman?\u201D Robin stepped up and answered in\r\na
    clear voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CI do! I, Robin Hood of Barnesdale and Sherwood! And
    he who takes her\r\nfrom Allan-a-Dale shall buy her full dearly.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    the twain were declared man and wife and duly blessed; and the bride\r\nwas kissed
    by each sturdy yeoman beginning with Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nNow I cannot end this
    jolly tale better than in the words of the ballad\r\nwhich came out of the happening
    and which has been sung in the villages\r\nand countryside ever since:\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CAnd thus having end of this merry wedding,\r\n     The bride lookt like
    a queen;\r\n     And so they returned to the merry greenwood\r\n     Amongst
    the leaves so green.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHOW THE WIDOW\u2019S
    THREE SONS WERE RESCUED\r\n\r\n     Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,\r\n    
    With a link a down and a down,\r\n     And there he met with the proud Sheriff,\r\n    
    Was walking along the town.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-party was a merry one that left
    Plympton Church, I ween; but\r\nnot so merry were the ones left behind. My lord
    Bishop of Hereford\r\nwas stuck up in the organ-loft and left, gownless and fuming.
    The ten\r\nliveried archers were variously disposed about the church to keep
    him\r\ncompany; two of them being locked in a tiny crypt, three in the belfry,\r\n\u201Cto
    ring us a wedding peal,\u201D as Robin said; and the others under\r\nquire seats
    or in the vestry. The bride\u2019s brother at her entreaty was\r\nreleased, but
    bidden not to return to the church that day or interfere\r\nwith his sister again
    on pain of death. While the rusty old knight was\r\nforced to climb a high tree,
    where he sat insecurely perched among the\r\nbranches, feebly cursing the party
    as it departed.\r\n\r\nIt was then approaching sundown, but none of the retainers
    or villagers\r\ndared rescue the imprisoned ones that night, for fear of Robin
    Hood\u2019s\r\nmen. So it was not until sunup the next day, that they were released.\r\nThe
    Bishop and the old knight, stiff as they were, did not delay longer\r\nthan for
    breakfast, but so great was their rage and shame--made straight\r\nto Nottingham
    and levied the Sheriff\u2019s forces. The Sheriff himself was\r\nnot anxious
    to try conclusions again with Robin in the open. Perhaps he\r\nhad some slight
    scruples regarding his oath. But the others swore that\r\nthey would go straight
    to the King, if he did not help them, so he was\r\nfain to consent.\r\n\r\nA
    force of an hundred picked men from the Royal Foresters and swordsmen\r\nof the
    shire was gathered together and marched straightway into the\r\ngreenwood. There,
    as fortune would have it, they surprised some score of\r\noutlaws hunting, and
    instantly gave chase. But they could not surround\r\nthe outlaws, who kept well
    in the lead, ever and anon dropping behind\r\na log or boulder to speed back
    a shaft which meant mischief to the\r\npursuers. One shaft indeed carried off
    the Sheriff\u2019s hat and caused\r\nthat worthy man to fall forward upon his
    horse\u2019s neck from sheer terror;\r\nwhile five other arrows landed in the
    fleshy parts of Foresters\u2019 arms.\r\n\r\nBut the attacking party was not
    wholly unsuccessful. One outlaw in his\r\nflight stumbled and fell; when two
    others instantly stopped and helped\r\nto put him on his feet again. They were
    the widow\u2019s three sons, Stout\r\nWill, and Lester, and John. The pause was
    an unlucky one for them, as\r\na party of Sheriff\u2019s men got above them and
    cut them off from their\r\nfellows. Swordsmen came up in the rear, and they were
    soon hemmed in on\r\nevery side. But they gave good account of themselves, and
    before they\r\nhad been overborne by force of numbers they had killed two and
    disabled\r\nthree more.\r\n\r\nThe infuriated attackers were almost on the point
    of hewing the stout\r\noutlaws to pieces, when the Sheriff cried:\r\n\r\n\u201CHold!
    Bind the villains! We will follow the law in this and take them\r\nto the town
    jail. But I promise ye the biggest public hanging that has\r\nbeen seen in this
    shire for many changes of the moon!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they bound the widow\u2019s
    three sons and carried them back speedily to\r\nNottingham.\r\n\r\nNow Robin
    Hood had not chanced to be near the scene of the fight, or\r\nwith his men; so
    for a time he heard nothing of the happening.\r\n\r\nBut that evening while returning
    to the camp he was met by the widow\r\nherself, who came weeping along the way.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    news, what news, good woman?\u201D said Robin hastily but courteously;\r\nfor
    he liked her well.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod save ye, Master Robin!\u201D said the dame
    wildly. \u201CGod keep ye from the\r\nfate that has met my three sons! The Sheriff
    has laid hands on them and\r\nthey are condemned to die.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,
    by our Lady! That cuts me to the heart! Stout Will, and Lester,\r\nand merry
    John! The earliest friends I had in the band, and still among\r\nthe bravest!
    It must not be! When is this hanging set?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMiddle the tinker
    tells me that it is for tomorrow noon,\u201D replied the\r\ndame.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    the truth o\u2019 my body,\u201D quoth Robin, \u201Cyou could not tell me in
    better\r\ntime. The memory of the old days when you freely bade me sup and dine\r\nwould
    spur me on, even if three of the bravest lads in all the shire\r\nwere not imperiled.
    Trust to me, good woman!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old widow threw herself on the ground
    and embraced his knees.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis dire danger I am asking ye to
    face,\u201D she said weeping; \u201Cand yet I\r\nknew your brave true heart would
    answer me. Heaven help ye, good Master\r\nRobin, to answer a poor widow\u2019s
    prayers!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Robin Hood sped straightway to the forest-camp, where
    he heard the\r\ndetails of the skirmish--how that his men had been out-numbered
    five to\r\none, but got off safely, as they thought, until a count of their members\r\nhad
    shown the loss of the widow\u2019s three sons.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must rescue them,
    my men!\u201D quoth Robin, \u201Ceven from out the shadow of\r\nthe rope itself!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhereupon
    the band set to work to devise ways and means.\r\n\r\nRobin walked apart a little
    way with his head leaned thoughtfully upon\r\nhis breast--for he was sore troubled--when
    whom should he meet but an\r\nold begging palmer, one of a devout order which
    made pilgrimages and\r\nwandered from place to place, supported by charity.\r\n\r\nThis
    old fellow walked boldly up to Robin and asked alms of him; since\r\nRobin had
    been wont to aid members of his order.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat news, what news, thou
    foolish old man?\u201D said Robin, \u201Cwhat news, I\r\ndo thee pray?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThree
    squires in Nottingham town,\u201D quoth the palmer, \u201Care condemned\r\nto
    die. Belike that is greater news than the shire has had in some\r\nSundays.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    Robin\u2019s long-sought idea came to him like a flash.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, change
    thine apparel with me, old man,\u201D he said, \u201Cand I\u2019ll give\r\nthee
    forty shillings in good silver to spend in beer or wine.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO,
    thine apparel is good,\u201D the palmer protested, \u201Cand mine is ragged\r\nand
    torn. The holy church teaches that thou should\u2019st ne\u2019er laugh an old\r\nman
    to scorn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am in simple earnest, I say. Come, change thine
    apparel with mine.\r\nHere are twenty pieces of good broad gold to feast they
    brethren right\r\nroyally.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the palmer was persuaded; and Robin
    put on the old man\u2019s hat, which\r\nstood full high in the crown; and his
    cloak, patched with black and\r\nblue and red, like Joseph\u2019s coat of many
    colors in its old age; and\r\nhis breeches, which had been sewed over with so
    many patterns that the\r\noriginal was scarce discernible; and his tattered hose;
    and his shoes,\r\ncobbled above and below. And while as he made the change in
    dress he\r\nmade so many whimsical comments also about a man\u2019s pride and
    the dress\r\nthat makes a man, that the palmer was like to choke with cackling\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nI
    warrant you, the two were comical sights when they parted company that\r\nday.
    Nathless, Robin\u2019s own mother would not have known him, had she been\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThe
    next morning the whole town of Nottingham was early astir, and as\r\nsoon as
    the gates were open country-folk began to pour in; for a triple\r\nhanging was
    not held there every day in the week, and the bustle almost\r\nequated a Fair
    day.\r\n\r\nRobin Hood in his palmer\u2019s disguise was one of the first ones
    to enter\r\nthe gates, and he strolled up and down and around the town as though
    he\r\nhad never been there before in all his life. Presently he came to the\r\nmarket-place,
    and beheld thereon three gallows erected.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are these builded
    for, my son?\u201D asked he of a rough soldier\r\nstanding by.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor
    three of Robin Hood\u2019s men,\u201D answered the other. \u201CAnd it were Robin\r\nhimself,
    \u2018twould be thrice as high I warrant ye. But Robin is too smart\r\nto get
    within the Sheriff\u2019s clutches again.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe palmer crossed himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    say that he is a bold fellow,\u201D he whined.\r\n\r\n\u201CHa!\u201D said the
    soldier, \u201Che may be bold enough out behind stumps i\u2019 the\r\nforest,
    but the open market-place is another matter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is to hang
    these three poor wretches?\u201D asked the palmer.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat hath the
    Sheriff not decided. But here he comes now to answer his\r\nown questions.\u201D
    And the soldier came to stiff attention as the Sheriff\r\nand his body-guard
    stalked pompously up to inspect the gallows.\r\n\r\n\u201CO, Heaven save you,
    worshipful Sheriff!\u201D said the palmer. \u201CHeaven\r\nprotect you! What
    will you give a silly old man to-day to be your\r\nhangman?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    are you, fellow?\u201D asked the Sheriff sharply.\r\n\r\n\u201CNaught save a
    poor old palmer. But I can shrive their souls and hang\r\ntheir bodies most devoutly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery
    good,\u201D replied the other. \u201CThe fee to-day is thirteen pence; and\r\nI
    will add thereunto some suits of clothing for that ragged back of\r\nyours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    bless ye!\u201D said the palmer. And he went with the soldier to the\r\njail
    to prepare his three men for execution.\r\n\r\nJust before the stroke of noon
    the doors of the prison opened and the\r\nprocession of the condemned came forth.
    Down through the long lines of\r\npacked people they walked to the market-place,
    the palmer in the lead,\r\nand the widow\u2019s three sons marching firmly erect
    between soldiers.\r\n\r\nAt the gallows foot they halted. The palmer whispered
    to them, as though\r\noffering last words of consolation; and the three men,
    with arms bound\r\ntightly behind their backs, ascended the scaffold, followed
    by their\r\nconfessor.\r\n\r\nThen Robin stepped to the edge of the scaffold,
    while the people grew\r\nstill as death; for they desired to hear the last words
    uttered to the\r\nvictims. But Robin\u2019s voice did not quaver forth weakly,
    as formerly,\r\nand his figure had stiffened bolt upright beneath the black robe
    that\r\ncovered his rags.\r\n\r\n\u201CHark ye, proud Sheriff!\u201D he cried.
    \u201CI was ne\u2019er a hangman in all my\r\nlife, nor do I now intend to begin
    that trade. Accurst be he who first\r\nset the fashion of hanging! I have but
    three more words to say. Listen\r\nto them!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd forth from the robe
    he drew his horn and blew three loud blasts\r\nthereon. Then his keen hunting-knife
    flew forth and in a trice, Stout\r\nWill, Lester, and merry John were free men
    and had sprung forward and\r\nseized the halberds from the nearest soldiers guarding
    the gallows.\r\n\r\n\u201CSeize them! \u2018Tis Robin Hood!\u201D screamed the
    Sheriff, \u201Can hundred pounds\r\nif ye hold them, dead or alive!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    make it two hundred!\u201D roared the fat Bishop.\r\n\r\nBut their voices were
    drowned in the uproar that ensued immediately\r\nafter Robin blew his horn. He
    himself had drawn his sword and leaped\r\ndown the stairs from the scaffold,
    followed by his three men. The guard\r\nhad closed around them in vain effort
    to disarm them, when \u201CA rescuer\u201D\r\n shouted Will Stutely\u2019s clear
    voice on one side of them, and \u201CA\r\nrescue!\u201D bellowed Little John\u2019s
    on the other; and down through the\r\nterror-stricken crowd rushed fourscore
    men in Lincoln green, their force\r\nseeming twice that number in the confusion.
    With swords drawn they fell\r\nupon the guard from every side at once. There
    was a brief clash of hot\r\nweapons, then the guard scattered wildly, and Robin
    Hood\u2019s men formed in\r\na compact mass around their leader and forced their
    way slowly down the\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\n\u201CSeize them! In the King\u2019s
    name!\u201D shrieked the Sheriff. \u201CClose the\r\ngates!\u201D\r\n\r\nIn truth,
    the peril would have been even greater, had this last order\r\nbeen carried out.
    But Will Scarlet and Allan-a-Dale had foreseen that\r\nevent, and had already
    overpowered the two warders.\r\n\r\nSo the gates stood wide open, and toward
    them the band of outlaws\r\nheaded.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers rallied a force of twice
    their number and tried resolutely\r\nto pierce their center. But the retreating
    force turned thrice and sent\r\nsuch volleys of keen arrows from their good yew
    bows, that they kept a\r\ndistance between the two forces.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the
    gate was reached, and the long road leading up the hill,\r\nand at last the protecting
    greenwood itself. The soldiers dared come no\r\nfarther. And the widow\u2019s
    three sons, I warrant you, supped more heartily\r\nthat night than ever before
    in their whole lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHOW A BEGGAR FILLED
    THE PUBLIC EYE\r\n\r\n     Good Robin accost him in his way,\r\n     To see what
    he might be;\r\n     If any beggar had money,\r\n     He thought some part had
    he.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning, soon after the stirring events told in the last\r\nchapter,
    Robin wandered forth alone down the road to Barnesdale, to see\r\nif aught had
    come of the Sheriff\u2019s pursuit. But all was still and\r\nserene and peaceful.
    No one was in sight save a solitary beggar who came\r\nsturdily along his way
    in Robin\u2019s direction. The beggar caught sight\r\nof Robin, at the same moment,
    as he emerged from the trees, but gave no\r\nsign of having seen him. He neither
    slackened nor quickened his pace,\r\nbut jogged forward merrily, whistling as
    he came, and beating time by\r\npunching holes in the dusty road with the stout
    pike-staff in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe curious look of the fellow arrested Robin\u2019s
    attention, and he\r\ndecided to stop and talk with him. The fellow was bare-legged
    and\r\nbare-armed, and wore a long shift of a shirt, fastened with a belt.\r\nAbout
    his neck hung a stout, bulging bag, which was buckled by a good\r\npiece of leather
    thong.\r\n\r\n     He had three hats upon his head,\r\n     Together sticked
    fast,\r\n     He cared neither for the wind nor wet,\r\n     In lands where\u2019er
    he past.\r\n\r\nThe fellow looked so fat and hearty, and the wallet on his shoulder\r\nseemed
    so well filled, that Robin thought within himself,\r\n\r\n\u201CHa! this is a
    lucky beggar for me! If any of them have money, this is\r\nthe chap, and, marry,
    he should share it with us poorer bodies.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo he flourished his own
    stick and planted himself in the traveler\u2019s\r\npath.\r\n\r\n\u201CSirrah,
    fellow!\u201D quoth he; \u201Cwhither away so fast? Tarry, for I would\r\nhave
    speech with ye!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe beggar made as though he heard him not, and
    kept straight on with\r\nhis faring.\r\n\r\n\u201CTarry, I say, fellow!\u201D
    said Robin again; \u201Cfor there\u2019s a way to make\r\nfolks obey!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    \u2018tis not so,\u201D answered the beggar, speaking for the first time; \u201CI\r\nobey
    no man in all England, not even the King himself. So let me pass on\r\nmy way,
    for \u2018tis growing late, and I have still far to go before I can\r\ncare for
    my stomach\u2019s good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, by my troth,\u201D said Robin,
    once more getting in front of the other,\r\n\u201CI see well by your fat countenance,
    that you lack not for good food,\r\nwhile I go hungry. Therefore you must lend
    me of your means till we meet\r\nagain, so that I may hie to the nearest tavern.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have no money to lend,\u201D said the beggar crossly. \u201CMethinks you are
    as\r\nyoung a man as I, and as well able to earn a supper. So go your way, and\r\nI\u2019ll
    go mine. If you fast till you get aught out of me, you\u2019ll go hungry\r\nfor
    the next twelvemonth.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot while I have a stout stick to thwack
    your saucy bones!\u201D cried\r\nRobin. \u201CStand and deliver, I say, or I\u2019ll
    dust your shirt for you; and\r\nif that will not teach you manners, then we\u2019ll
    see what a broad arrow\r\ncan do with a beggar\u2019s skin!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    beggar smiled, and answered boast with boast. \u201CCome on with your\r\nstaff,
    fellow! I care no more for it than for a pudding stick. And as\r\nfor your pretty
    bow--_that_ for it!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with amazing quickness, he swung his pike-staff
    around and knocked\r\nRobin\u2019s bow clean out of his hand, so that his fingers
    smarted with\r\npain. Robin danced and tried to bring his own staff into action;
    but\r\nthe beggar never gave him a chance. Biff! whack! came the pike-staff,\r\nsmiting
    him soundly and beating down his guard.\r\n\r\nThere were but two things to do;
    either stand there and take a sound\r\ndrubbing, or beat a hasty retreat. Robin
    chose the latter--as you or I\r\nwould probably have done--and scurried back
    into the wood, blowing his\r\nhorn as he went.\r\n\r\n\u201CFie, for shame, man!\u201D
    jeered the bold beggar after him. \u201CWhat is your\r\nhaste? We had but just
    begun. Stay and take your money, else you will\r\nnever be able to pay your reckoning
    at the tavern!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Robin answered him never a word. He fled up hill
    and down dale till\r\nhe met three of his men who were running up in answer to
    his summons.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is wrong?\u201D they asked.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis
    a saucy beggar,\u201D said Robin, catching his breath. \u201CHe is back\r\nthere
    on the highroad with the hardest stick I\u2019ve met in a good many\r\ndays.
    He gave me no chance to reason with him, the dirty scamp!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe men--Much
    and two of the widow\u2019s sons--could scarce conceal their\r\nmirth at the
    thought of Robin Hood running from a beggar. Nathless, they\r\nkept grave faces,
    and asked their leader if he was hurt.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D he replied, \u201Cbut
    I shall speedily feel better if you will fetch\r\nme that same beggar and let
    me have a fair chance at him.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the three yeomen made haste and
    came out upon the highroad and\r\nfollowed after the beggar, who was going smoothly
    along his way again,\r\nas though he were at peace with all the world.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    easiest way to settle this beggar,\u201D said Much, \u201Cis to surprise\r\nhim.
    Let us cut through yon neck of woods and come upon him before he is\r\naware.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    others agreed to this, and the three were soon close upon their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow!\u201D
    quoth Much; and the other two sprang quickly upon the beggar\u2019s\r\nback and
    wrested his pike-staff from his hand. At the same moment Much\r\ndrew his dagger
    and flashed it before the fellow\u2019s breast.\r\n\r\n\u201CYield you, my man!\u201D
    cried he; \u201Cfor a friend of ours awaits you in the\r\nwood, to teach you
    how to fight properly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me a fair chance,\u201D said the
    beggar valiantly, \u201Cand I\u2019ll fight you\r\nall at once.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    they would not listen to him. Instead, they turned him about and\r\nbegan to
    march him toward the forest. Seeing that it was useless to\r\nstruggle, the beggar
    began to parley.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood my masters,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cwhy use
    this violence? I will go with ye\r\nsafe and quietly, if ye insist, but if ye
    will set me free I\u2019ll make\r\nit worth your while. I\u2019ve a hundred pounds
    in my bag here. Let me go my\r\nway, and ye shall have all that\u2019s in the
    bag.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe three outlaws took council together at this.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    say you?\u201D asked Much of the others. \u201COur master will be more glad\r\nto
    see this beggar\u2019s wallet than his sorry face.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other two
    agreed, and the little party came to a halt and loosed\r\nhold of the beggar.\r\n\r\n\u201CCount
    out your gold speedily, friend,\u201D said Much. There was a brisk\r\nwind blowing,
    and the beggar turned about to face it, directly they had\r\nunhanded him.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    shall be done, gossips,\u201D said he. \u201COne of you lend me your cloak and\r\nwe
    will spread it upon the ground and put the wealth upon it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cloak
    was handed him, and he placed his wallet upon it as though\r\nit were very heavy
    indeed. Then he crouched down and fumbled with\r\nthe leather fastenings. The
    outlaws also bent over and watched the\r\nproceeding closely, lest he should
    hide some of the money on his person.\r\nPresently he got the bag unfastened
    and plunged his hands into it. Forth\r\nfrom it he drew--not shining gold--but
    handfuls of fine meal which he\r\ndashed into the eager faces of the men around
    him. The wind aided him\r\nin this, and soon there arose a blinding cloud which
    filled the eyes,\r\nnoses, and mouths of the three outlaws till they could scarcely
    see or\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nWhile they gasped and choked and sputtered and felt
    around wildly for\r\nthat rogue of a beggar, he finished the job by picking up
    the cloak\r\nby its corners and shaking it vigorously in the faces of his suffering\r\nvictims.
    Then he seized a stick which lay conveniently near, and began\r\nto rain blows
    down upon their heads, shoulders, and sides, all the time\r\ndancing first on
    one leg, then on the other, and crying,\r\n\r\n\u201CVillains! rascals! here
    are the hundred pounds I promised. How do you\r\nlike them? I\u2019 faith, you\u2019ll
    get all that\u2019s in the bag.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhack! whack! whack! whack! went
    the stick, emphasizing each word. Howls\r\nof pain might have gone up from the
    sufferers, but they had too much\r\nmeal in their throats for that. Their one
    thought was to flee, and they\r\nstumbled off blindly down the road, the beggar
    following them a little\r\nway to give them a few parting love-taps.\r\n\r\n\u201CFare
    ye well, my masters,\u201D he said finally turning the other way; \u201Cand\r\nwhen
    next I come along the Barnesdale road, I hope you will be able to\r\ntell gold
    from meal dust!\u201D\r\n\r\nWith this he departed, an easy victor, and again
    went whistling on his\r\nway, while the three outlaws rubbed the meal out of
    their eyes and began\r\nto catch their breath again.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they could
    look around them clearly, they beheld Robin\r\nHood leaning against a tree trunk
    and surveying them smilingly. He had\r\nrecovered his own spirits in full measure,
    on seeing their plight.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod save ye, gossips!\u201D he said, \u201Cye
    must, in sooth, have gone the wrong\r\nway and been to the mill, from the looks
    of your clothes.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen when they looked shamefaced and answered never
    a word, he went on,\r\nin a soft voice,\r\n\r\n\u201CDid ye see aught of that
    bold beggar I sent you for, lately?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn sooth, master,\u201D
    responded Much the miller\u2019s son, \u201Cwe heard more of\r\nhim than we saw
    him. He filled us so full of meal that I shall sweat\r\nmeal for a week. I was
    born in a mill, and had the smell of meal in my\r\nnostrils from my very birth,
    you might say, and yet never before did I\r\nsee such a quantity of the stuff
    in so small space.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he sneezed violently.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow was
    that?\u201D asked Robin demurely.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy we laid hold of the beggar,
    as you did order, when he offered to\r\npay for his release out of the bag he
    carried upon his back.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe same I coveted,\u201D quoth Robin
    as if to himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo we agreed to this,\u201D went on Much, \u201Cand
    spread a cloak down, and he\r\nopened his bag and shook it thereon. Instantly
    a great cloud of meal\r\nfilled the air, whereby we could neither see nor breathe;
    and in the\r\nmidst of this cloud he vanished like a wizard.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    not before he left certain black and blue spots, to be remembered\r\nby, I see,\u201D
    commented Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe was in league with the evil one,\u201D said
    one of the widow\u2019s sons,\r\nrubbing himself ruefully.\r\n\r\nThen Robin
    laughed outright, and sat him down upon the gnarled root of a\r\ntree, to finish
    his merriment.\r\n\r\n\u201CFour bold outlaws, put to rout by a sorry beggar!\u201D
    cried he. \u201CI can\r\nlaugh at ye, my men, for I am in the same boat with
    ye. But \u2018twould\r\nnever do to have this tale get abroad--even in the greenwood--how
    that\r\nwe could not hold our own with the odds in our favor. So let us have\r\nthis
    little laugh all to ourselves, and no one else need be the wiser!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    others saw the point of this, and felt better directly, despite\r\ntheir itching
    desire to get hold of the beggar again. And none of the\r\nfour ever told of
    the adventure.\r\n\r\nBut the beggar must have boasted of it at the next tavern;
    or a little\r\nbird perched among the branches of a neighboring oak must have
    sung\r\nof it. For it got abroad, as such tales will, and was put into a right\r\ndroll
    ballad which, I warrant you, the four outlaws did not like to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XI\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD FOUGHT GUY OF GISBORNE\r\n\r\n     \u201CI dwell by
    dale and down,\u201D quoth he,\r\n     \u201CAnd Robin to take I\u2019m sworn;\r\n    
    And when I am called by my right name,\r\n     I am Guy of good Gisborne.\u201D\r\n\r\nSome
    weeks passed after the rescue of the widow\u2019s three sons; weeks\r\nspent
    by the Sheriff in the vain effort to entrap Robin Hood and his\r\nmen. For Robin\u2019s
    name and deeds had come to the King\u2019s ears, in London\r\ntown, and he sent
    word to the Sheriff to capture the outlaw, under\r\npenalty of losing his office.
    So the Sheriff tried every manner of means\r\nto surprise Robin Hood in the forest,
    but always without success. And he\r\nincreased the price put upon Robin\u2019s
    head, in the hope that the best men\r\nof the kingdom could be induced to try
    their skill at a capture.\r\n\r\nNow there was a certain Guy of Gisborne, a hireling
    knight of the King\u2019s\r\narmy, who heard of Robin and of the price upon his
    head. Sir Guy was one\r\nof the best men at the bow and the sword in all the
    King\u2019s service.\r\nBut his heart was black and treacherous. He obtained
    the King\u2019s leave\r\nforthwith to seek out the forester; and armed with the
    King\u2019s scroll he\r\ncame before the Sheriff at Nottingham.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have come to capture Robin Hood,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand mean to have him,\r\ndead
    or alive.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRight gladly would I aid you,\u201D answered the
    Sheriff, \u201Ceven if the\r\nKing\u2019s seal were not sufficient warrant. How
    many men need you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNone,\u201D replied Sir Guy, \u201Cfor
    I am convinced that forces of men can\r\nnever come at the bold robber. I must
    needs go alone. But do you hold\r\nyour men in readiness at Barnesdale, and when
    you hear a blast from this\r\nsilver bugle, come quickly, for I shall have the
    sly Robin within my\r\nclutches.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery good,\u201D said the
    Sheriff. \u201CMarry, it shall be done.\u201D And he set\r\nabout giving orders,
    while Guy of Gisborne sallied forth disguised.\r\n\r\nNow as luck would have
    it, Will Scarlet and Little John had gone to\r\nBarnesdale that very day to buy
    suits of Lincoln green for certain of\r\nthe yeomen who had come out at the knees
    and elbows. But not deeming it\r\nbest for both of them to run their necks into
    a noose, together, they\r\nparted just outside the town, and Will went within
    the gates, while John\r\ntarried and watched at the brow of the hill on the outside.\r\n\r\nPresently
    whom should he see but this same Will flying madly forth from\r\nthe gates again,
    closely pursued by the Sheriff and threescore men. Over\r\nthe moat Will sprang,
    through the bushes and briars, across the swamp,\r\nover stocks and stones, up
    the woodland roads in long leaps like a\r\nscared jack rabbit. And after him
    puffed the Sheriff and his men, their\r\nforce scattering out in the flight as
    one man would tumble head-first\r\ninto a ditch, another mire up in the swamp,
    another trip over a rolling\r\nstone, and still others sit down on the roadside
    and gasp for wind like\r\nfish out of water.\r\n\r\nLittle John could not forbear
    laughing heartily at the scene, though\r\nhe knew that \u2018twould be anything
    but a laughing matter if Will should\r\nstumble. And in truth one man was like
    to come upon him. It was\r\nWilliam-a-Trent, the best runner among the Sheriff\u2019s
    men. He had come\r\nwithin twenty feet of Scarlet and was leaping upon him with
    long bounds\r\nlike a greyhound, when John rose up quickly, drew his bow and
    let fly\r\none of his fatal shafts. It would have been better for William-a-Trent\r\nto
    have been abed with sorrow--says the ballad--than to be that day in\r\nthe greenwood
    slade to meet with Little John\u2019s arrow. He had run his\r\nlast race.\r\n\r\nThe
    others halted a moment in consternation, when the shaft came\r\nhurtling down
    from the hill; but looking up they beheld none save Little\r\nJohn, and with
    a cry of fierce joy they turned upon him. Meanwhile Will\r\nScarlet had reached
    the brow of the hill and sped down the other side.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll just
    send one more little message of regret to the Sheriff,\u201D said\r\nLittle John,
    \u201Cbefore I join Will.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut this foolhardy deed was his undoing,
    for just as the arrow left the\r\nstring, the good yew bow that had never before
    failed him snapped in\r\ntwain.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoe worth, woe worth thee, wicked
    wood, that ere thou grew on a\r\ntree!\u201D cursed Little John, and planted
    his feet resolutely in the earth\r\nresolved to sell the path dearly; for the
    soldiers were now so close\r\nupon him that he dared not turn.\r\n\r\nAnd a right
    good account of himself he gave that day, dealing with\r\neach man as he came
    up according to his merit. And so winded were the\r\npursuers when they reached
    the top of the hill that he laid out the\r\nfirst ten of them right and left
    with huge blows of his brawny fist.\r\n\r\nBut if five men can do more than three,
    a score can overcome one.\r\n\r\nA body of archers stood off at a prudent distance
    and covered Little\r\nJohn with their arrows.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow yield you!\u201D
    panted the Sheriff. \u201CYield you, Little John, or Reynold\r\nGreenleaf, or
    whatever else name you carry this day! Yield you, or some\r\nfew of these shafts
    will reach your heart!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry, my heart has been touched by
    your words ere now,\u201D said Little\r\nJohn; \u201Cand I yield me.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    the Sheriff\u2019s men laid hold of Little John and bound him fast with\r\nmany
    cords, so fearful were they lest he should escape. And the Sheriff\r\nlaughed
    aloud in glee, and thought of how he should avenge his stolen\r\nplate, and determined
    to make a good day\u2019s work of it.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy the Saints!\u201D he said,
    \u201Cyou shall be drawn by dale and down, and\r\nhanged high on a hill in Barnesdale
    this very day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHang and be hanged!\u201D retorted the prisoner.
    \u201CYou may fail of your\r\npurpose if it be Heaven\u2019s will.\u201D\r\n\r\nBack
    down the hill and across the moor went the company speedily, for\r\nthey feared
    a rescue. And as they went the stragglers joined them. Here\r\na man got up feebly
    out of the ditch and rubbed his pate and fell in\r\nlike a chicken with the pip
    going for its dinner. Yonder came hobbling\r\na man with a lame ankle, or another
    with his shins torn by the briars or\r\nanother with his jacket all muddy from
    the marsh. So in truth it was\r\na tatterdemalion crew that limped and straggled
    and wandered back into\r\nBarnesdale that day. Yet all were merry, for the Sheriff
    had promised\r\nthem flagons of wine, and moreover they were to hang speedily
    the\r\nboldest outlaw in England, next to Robin Hood himself.\r\n\r\nThe gallows
    was quickly put up and a new rope provided.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow up with you!\u201D
    commanded the Sheriff, \u201Cand let us see if your\r\ngreenwood tricks will
    avail you to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would that I had bold Robin\u2019s
    horn,\u201D muttered poor John; \u201Cmethinks\r\n\u2018tis all up with me even
    as the Sheriff hath spoken.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn good sooth the time was dire and
    pressing. The rope was placed around\r\nthe prisoner\u2019s neck and the men
    prepared to haul away.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you ready?\u201D called the Sheriff.
    \u201COne--two--\u201D\r\n\r\nBut before the \u201Cthree\u201D left his lips
    the faint sound of a silver bugle\r\ncame floating over the hill.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    my troth, that is Sir Guy of Gisborne\u2019s horn,\u201D quoth the Sheriff;\r\n\u201Cand
    he bade me not to delay answering its summons. He has caught Robin\r\nHood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPardon,
    Excellency,\u201D said one of his men; \u201Cbut if he has caught Robin\r\nHood,
    this is a merry day indeed. And let us save this fellow and build\r\nanother
    gallows and hang them both together.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a brave thought!\u201D
    said the Sheriff slapping his knee. \u201CTake the\r\nrascal down and bind him
    fast to the gallows-tree against our return.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Little John was
    made fast to the gallows-tree, while the Sheriff and\r\nall his men who could
    march or hobble went out to get Robin Hood and\r\nbring him in for the double
    hanging.\r\n\r\nLet us leave talking of Little John and the Sheriff, and see
    what has\r\nbecome of Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he and Little John
    had come near having a quarrel\r\nthat self-same morning because both had seen
    a curious looking yeoman,\r\nand each wanted to challenge him singly. But Robin
    would not give way to\r\nhis lieutenant, and that is why John, in a huff, had
    gone with Will to\r\nBarnesdale.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robin approached the curious
    looking stranger. He seemed to be\r\na three-legged creature at first sight,
    but on coming nearer you would\r\nhave seen that \u2018twas really naught but
    a poorly clad man, who for a\r\nfreak had covered up his rags with a capul-hide,
    nothing more nor less\r\nthan the sun-dried skin of a horse, complete with head,
    tail, and mane.\r\nThe skin of the head made a helmet; while the tail gave the
    curious\r\nthree-legged appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-morrow, good fellow,\u201D
    said Robin cheerily, \u201Cmethinks by the bow\r\nyou bear in your hand that
    you should be a good archer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndifferent good,\u201D said
    the other returning his greeting; \u201Cbut \u2018tis not\r\nof archery that
    I am thinking this morning, for I have lost my way and\r\nwould fain find it
    again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy my faith, I could have believed \u2018twas your
    wits you\u2019d lost!\u201D thought\r\nRobin smiling. Then aloud: \u201CI\u2019ll
    lead you through the wood,\u201D quoth\r\nhe, \u201Can you will tell me your
    business. For belike your speech is much\r\ngentler than your attire.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    are you to ask me my business?\u201D asked the other roughly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am one of the King\u2019s Rangers,\u201D replied Robin, \u201Cset here to guard
    his\r\ndeer against curious looking strollers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCurious looking
    I may be,\u201D returned the other, \u201Cbut no stroller. Hark\r\nye, since
    you are a Ranger, I must e\u2019en demand your service. I am on the\r\nKing\u2019s
    business and seek an outlaw. Men call him Robin Hood. Are you one\r\nof his men?\u201D--eyeing
    him keenly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, God forbid!\u201D said Robin; \u201Cbut what want
    you with him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is another tale. But I\u2019d rather meet
    with that proud outlaw than\r\nforty good pounds of the King\u2019s money.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin
    now saw how the land lay.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome with me, good yeoman,\u201D said
    he, \u201Cand belike, a little later in the\r\nday, I can show you Robin\u2019s
    haunts when he is at home. Meanwhile let us\r\nhave some pastime under the greenwood
    tree. Let us first try the mastery\r\nat shooting arrows.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other
    agreed, and they cut down two willow wands of a summer\u2019s\r\ngrowth that
    grew beneath a brier, and set them up at a distance of\r\nthreescore yards.\r\n\r\n\u201CLead
    on, good fellow,\u201D quoth Robin. \u201CThe first shot to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    by my faith,\u201D said the other, \u201CI will follow your lead.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    Robin stepped forth and bent his bow carelessly and sent his\r\nshaft whizzing
    toward the wand, missing it by a scant inch. He of the\r\nhorse-hide followed
    with more care yet was a good three-fingers\u2019 breadth\r\naway. On the second
    round, the stranger led off and landed cleverly\r\nwithin the small garland at
    the top of the wand; but Robin shot far\r\nbetter and clave the wand itself,
    clean at the middle.\r\n\r\n\u201CA blessing on your heart!\u201D shouted Capul-Hide;
    \u201Cnever saw I such\r\nshooting as that! Belike you are better than Robin
    Hood himself. But you\r\nhave not yet told me your name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    by my faith,\u201D quoth Robin, \u201CI must keep it secret till you have\r\ntold
    me your own.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not disdain to tell it,\u201D said the other.
    \u201CI dwell by dale and\r\ndown, and to take bold Robin am I sworn. This would
    I tell him to his\r\nface, were he not so great a craven. When I am called by
    my right name,\r\nI am Guy of Gisborne.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis he said with a great
    show of pride, and he strutted back and forth,\r\nforgetful that he had just
    been beaten at archery.\r\n\r\nRobin eyed him quietly. \u201CMethinks I have
    heard of you elsewhere. Do you\r\nnot bring men to the gallows for a living?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    but only outlaws such as Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut pray what harm has
    Robin Hood done you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is a highway robber,\u201D said Sir
    Guy, evading the question.\r\n\r\n\u201CHas he ever taken from the rich that
    he did not give again to the\r\npoor? Does he not protect the women and children
    and side with weak and\r\nhelpless? Is not his greatest crime the shooting of
    a few King\u2019s deer?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave done with your sophistry,\u201D
    said Sir Guy impatiently. \u201CI am more\r\nthan ever of opinion that you are
    one of Robin\u2019s men yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have told you I am not,\u201D
    quoth Robin briefly. \u201CBut if I am to help\r\nyou catch him, what is your
    plan?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you see this silver bugle?\u201D said the other.
    \u201CA long blast upon it\r\nwill summon the Sheriff and all his men, when once
    I have Robin within\r\nmy grasp. And if you show him to me, I\u2019ll give you
    the half of my forty\r\npounds reward.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would not help hang
    a man for ten times forty pounds,\u201D said the\r\noutlaw. \u201CYet will I
    point out Robin to you for the reward I find at my\r\nsword\u2019s point. I myself
    am Robin Hood of Sherwood and Barnesdale.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen have at you!\u201D
    cried the other springing swiftly into action. His\r\nsword leaped forth from
    beneath the horse\u2019s hide with the speed born of\r\nlong practice, and before
    Robin had come to guard, the other had smitten\r\nat him full and foul. Robin
    eluded the lunge and drew his own weapon.\r\n\r\n\u201CA scurvy trick!\u201D
    quoth he grimly, \u201Cto strike at a man unprepared.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen neither
    spoke more, but fell sternly to work--lunge and thrust and\r\nward and parry--for
    two full hours the weapons smote together sullenly,\r\nand neither Robin Hood
    nor Sir Guy would yield an inch. I promise you\r\nthat if you could have looked
    forth on the fight from behind the trunk\r\nof some friendly tree, you would
    have seen deadly sport such as few\r\nmen beheld in Sherwood Forest. For the
    fighters glared sullenly at each\r\nother, the fires of hatred burning in their
    eyes. One was fighting for\r\nhis life; the other for a reward and the King\u2019s
    favor.\r\n\r\nStill circled the bright blades swiftly in the air--now gleaming
    in the\r\npeaceful sunlight--again hissing like maddened serpents. Neither had
    yet\r\ntouched the other, until Robin, in an unlucky moment, stumbled over\r\nthe
    projecting root of a tree; when Sir Guy, instead of giving him the\r\nchance
    to recover himself, as any courteous knight would have done,\r\nstruck quickly
    at the falling man and wounded him in the left side.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, dear Lady
    in Heaven,\u201D gasped Robin uttering his favorite prayer,\r\n\u201Cshield me
    now! \u2018Twas never a man\u2019s destiny to die before his day.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    adroitly he sprang up again, and came straight at the other with an\r\nawkward
    but unexpected stroke. The knight had raised his weapon high to\r\ngive a final
    blow, when Robin reached beneath and across his guard.\r\nOne swift lunge, and
    Sir Guy of Gisborne staggered backward with a deep\r\ngroan, Robin\u2019s sword
    through his throat.\r\n\r\nRobin looked at the slain man regretfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    did bring it upon yourself,\u201D said he; \u201Cand traitor and hireling\r\nthough
    you were, I would not willingly have killed you.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe looked to his
    own wound. It was not serious, and he soon staunched\r\nthe blood and bound up
    the cut. Then he dragged the dead body into the\r\nbushes, and took off the horse\u2019s
    hide and put it upon himself. He placed\r\nhis own cloak upon Sir Guy, and marked
    his face so none might tell who\r\nhad been slain. Robin\u2019s own figure and
    face were not unlike the other\u2019s.\r\n\r\nPulling the capul-hide well over
    himself, so that the helmet hid most\r\nof his face, Robin seized the silver
    bugle and blew a long blast. It was\r\nthe blast that saved the life of Little
    John, over in Barnesdale, for\r\nyou and I have already seen how it caused the
    fond Sheriff to prick up\r\nhis ears and stay the hanging, and go scurrying up
    over the hill and\r\ninto the wood with his men in search of another victim.\r\n\r\nIn
    five-and-twenty minutes up came running a score of the Sheriff\u2019s best\r\narchers.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid
    you signal us, lording?\u201D they asked, approaching Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,\u201D
    said he, going to meet the puffing Sheriff.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat news, what news,
    Sir Guy?\u201D said that officer.\r\n\r\n\u201CRobin Hood and Guy of Gisborne
    had a fight; and he that wears Robin\u2019s\r\ncloak lies under the covert yonder.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    best news I have heard in all my life!\u201D exclaimed the Sheriff\r\nrubbing
    his hands. \u201CI would that we could have saved him for the\r\nhanging--though
    I cannot now complain.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe hanging?\u201D repeated Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes.
    This is our lucky day on the calendar. After you left me we\r\nnarrowly missed
    running one of the fellows--I believe \u2018twas Will\r\nScarlet--to earth; and
    another who came to his relief we were just about\r\nto hang, when your horn
    blew.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho was the other?\u201D asked the disguised outlaw.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhom
    do you suppose?\u201D laughed the Sheriff. \u201CThe best man in the\r\ngreenwood,
    next to Robin Hood himself--Little John, Reynold Greenleaf!\u201D\r\n For the
    Sheriff could not forget the name Little John had borne under\r\nhis own roof
    at Nottingham.\r\n\r\n\u201CLittle John!\u201D thought Robin with a start. Verily
    that was a lucky\r\nblast of the bugle! \u201CBut I see you have not escaped
    without a scratch,\u201D\r\n continued the Sheriff, becoming talkative through
    pure glee. \u201CHere, one\r\nof you men! Give Sir Guy of Gisborne your horse;
    while others of you\r\nbury that dog of an outlaw where he lies. And let us hasten
    back to\r\nBarnesdale and finish hanging the other.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they put
    spurs to their horses, and as they rode Robin forced himself\r\nto talk merrily,
    while all the time he was planning the best way to\r\nsuccor Little John.\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    boon, Sheriff,\u201D he said as they reached the gates of the town.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    is it, worthy sir? You have but to speak.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not want any
    of your gold, for I have had a brave fight. But now\r\nthat I have slain the
    master, let me put an end to the man; so it shall\r\nbe said that Guy of Gisborne
    despatched the two greatest outlaws of\r\nEngland in one day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave
    it as you will,\u201D said the Sheriff, \u201Cbut you should have asked a\r\nknight\u2019s
    fee and double your reward, and it would have been yours. It\r\nisn\u2019t every
    man that can take Robin Hood.\u201D \u201CNo, Excellency,\u201D answered\r\nRobin.
    \u201CI say it without boasting, that no man took Robin Hood yesterday\r\nand
    none shall take him to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen he approached Little John, who
    was still tied to the gallows-tree;\r\nand he said to the Sheriff\u2019s men,
    \u201CNow stand you back here till I see if\r\nthe prisoner has been shrived.\u201D
    And he stooped swiftly, and cut Little\r\nJohn\u2019s bonds, and thrust into
    his hands Sir Guy\u2019s bow and arrows, which\r\nhe had been careful to take.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis
    I, Robin!\u201D he whispered. But in truth, Little John knew it\r\nalready, and
    had decided there was to be no hanging that day.\r\n\r\nThen Robin blew three
    loud blasts upon his own horn, and drew forth his\r\nown bow; and before the
    astonished Sheriff and his men could come to\r\narms the arrows were whistling
    in their midst in no uncertain fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd look! Through the gates and
    over the walls came pouring another\r\nflight of arrows! Will Scarlet and Will
    Stutely had watched and planned\r\na rescue ever since the Sheriff and Robin
    rode back down the hill. Now\r\nin good time they came; and the Sheriff\u2019s
    demoralized force turned tail\r\nand ran, while Robin and Little John stood under
    the harmless gallows,\r\nand sped swift arrows after them, and laughed to see
    them go.\r\n\r\nThen they joined their comrades and hasted back to the good greenwood,\r\nand
    there rested. They had got enough sport for one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XII\r\n\r\nHOW MAID MARIAN CAME BACK TO SHERWOOD FOREST; ALSO, HOW ROBIN HOOD
    CAME\r\nBEFORE QUEEN ELEANOR.\r\n\r\n     But Robin Hood, he himself had disguis\u2019d,\r\n    
    And Marian was strangely attir\u2019d,\r\n     That they proved foes, and so
    fell to blows,\r\n     Whose valor bold Robin admir\u2019d.\r\n\r\n     And when
    he came at London\u2019s court,\r\n     He fell down on his knee.\r\n     \u201CThou
    art welcome, Lockesley,\u201D said the Queen,\r\n     \u201CAnd all thy good
    yeomandree.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow it fell out that one day not long thereafter, Robin
    was minded to\r\ntry his skill at hunting. And not knowing whom he might meet
    in his\r\nrambles, he stained his face and put on a sorry-looking jacket and
    a\r\nlong cloak before he sallied forth. As he walked, the peacefulness of\r\nthe
    morning came upon him, and brought back to his memory the early days\r\nso long
    ago when he had roamed these same glades with Marian. How sweet\r\nthey seemed
    to him now, and how far away! Marian, too, the dainty friend\r\nof his youth--would
    he ever see her again? He had thought of her very\r\noften of late, and each
    time with increasing desire to hear her clear\r\nvoice and musical laugh, and
    see her eyes light up at his coming.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the happiness of Allen-a-Dale
    and his lady had caused Robin\u2019s\r\nheart-strings to vibrate more strongly;
    perhaps, too, the coming of\r\nWill Scarlet. But, certes, Robin was anything
    but a hunter this bright\r\nmorning as he walked along with head drooping in
    a most love-lorn way.\r\n\r\nPresently a hart entered the glade in full view
    of him, grazing\r\npeacefully, and instantly the man of action awoke. His bow
    was drawn\r\nand a shaft all but loosed, when the beast fell suddenly, pierced
    by a\r\nclever arrow from the far side of the glade.\r\n\r\nThen a handsome little
    page sprang gleefully from the covert and ran\r\ntoward the dying animal. This
    was plainly the archer, for he flourished\r\nhis bow aloft, and likewise bore
    a sword at his side, though for all\r\nthat he looked a mere lad.\r\n\r\nRobin
    approached the hart from the other side.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow dare you shoot the
    King\u2019s beasts, stripling?\u201D he asked severely.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have as
    much right to shoot them as the King himself,\u201D answered the\r\npage haughtily.
    \u201CHow dare you question me?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe voice stirred Robin strongly.
    It seemed to chime into his memories\r\nof the old days. He looked at the page
    sharply, and the other returned\r\nthe glance, straight and unafraid.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    are you, my lad?\u201D Robin said more civilly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo lad of yours,
    and my name\u2019s my own,\u201D retorted the other with spirit.\r\n\r\n\u201CSoftly!
    Fair and softly, sweet page, or we of the forest will have to\r\nteach you manners!\u201D
    said Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot if _you_ stand for the forest!\u201D cried the page,
    whipping out his\r\nsword. \u201CCome, draw, and defend yourself!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    swung his blade valiantly; and Robin saw nothing for it but to draw\r\nlikewise.
    The page thereupon engaged him quite fiercely, and Robin found\r\nthat he had
    many pretty little tricks at fencing.\r\n\r\nNathless, Robin contented himself
    with parrying, and was loth to exert\r\nall his superior strength upon the lad.
    So the fight lasted for above a\r\nquarter of an hour, at the end of which time
    the page was almost spent\r\nand the hot blood flushed his cheeks in a most charming
    manner.\r\n\r\nThe outlaw saw his distress, and to end the fight allowed himself
    to be\r\npricked slightly on the wrist.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you satisfied, fellow?\u201D
    asked the page, wincing a little at sight\r\nof the blood.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    honestly,\u201D replied Robin; \u201Cand now perhaps you will grant me the\r\nhonor
    of knowing to whom I owe this scratch?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am Richard Partington,
    page to Her Majesty, Queen Eleanor,\u201D answered\r\nthe lad with dignity; and
    again the sound of his voice troubled Robin\r\nsorely.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy come
    you to the greenwood alone, Master Partington?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe lad considered
    his answer while wiping his sword with a small lace\r\nkerchief. The action brought
    a dim confused memory to Robin. The lad\r\nfinally looked him again in the eye.\r\n\r\n\u201CForester,
    whether or no you be a King\u2019s man, know that I seek one Robin\r\nHood, an
    outlaw, to whom I bring amnesty from the Queen. Can you tell me\r\naught of him?\u201D
    And while awaiting his answer, he replaced the kerchief\r\nin his shirt. As he
    did so, the gleam of a golden trophy caught the\r\noutlaw\u2019s eye.\r\n\r\nRobin
    started forward with a joyful cry.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! I know you now! By the sight
    of yon golden arrow won at the\r\nSheriff\u2019s tourney, you are she on whom
    I bestowed it, and none other\r\nthan Maid Marian!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou--are--?\u201D
    gasped Marian, for it was she; \u201Cnot Robin!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRobin\u2019s
    self!\u201D said he gaily; and forthwith, clad as he was in rags,\r\nand stained
    of face, he clasped the dainty page close to his breast, and\r\nshe forsooth
    yielded right willingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut Robin!\u201D she exclaimed presently,
    \u201CI knew you not, and was rude, and\r\nwounded you!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Twas
    nothing,\u201D he replied laughingly, \u201Cso long as it brought me you.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    she made more ado over the sore wrist than Robin had received for\r\nall his
    former hurts put together. And she bound it with the little\r\nkerchief, and
    said, \u201CNow \u2018twill get well!\u201D and Robin was convinced she\r\nspoke
    the truth, for he never felt better in all his life. The whole\r\nwoods seemed
    tinged with a roseate hue, since Marian had come again.\r\n\r\nBut she, while
    happy also, was ill at ease; and Robin with a man\u2019s slow\r\ndiscernment
    at last saw that it was because of her boy\u2019s attire. He\r\nthought bluntly
    that there was naught to be ashamed of, yet smilingly\r\nhanded her his tattered
    long cloak, which she blushingly put on, and\r\nforthwith recovered her spirits
    directly.\r\n\r\nThen they began to talk of each other\u2019s varied fortunes,
    and of the many\r\nthings which had parted them; and so much did they find to
    tell that the\r\nsun had begun to decline well into the afternoon before they
    realized\r\nhow the hours sped.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am but a sorry host!\u201D exclaimed
    Robin, springing to his feet. \u201CI have\r\nnot once invited you to my wild
    roof.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I am but a sorry page,\u201D replied Marian; \u201Cfor
    I had clean forgot\r\nthat I was Richard Partington, and really did bring you
    a message from\r\nQueen Eleanor!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell me on our way home,
    and there you shall be entrusted to Mistress\r\nDale. While the first of my men
    we meet will I send back for your deer.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo she told him, as they
    walked back through the glade, how that the\r\nfame of his prowess had reached
    Queen Eleanor\u2019s ears, in London town.\r\nAnd the Queen had said, \u201CFain
    would I see this bold yeoman, and behold\r\nhis skill at the long-bow.\u201D
    And the Queen had promised him amnesty if\r\nhe and four of his archers would
    repair to London against the next\r\ntournament the week following, there to
    shoot against King Henry\u2019s\r\npicked men, of whom the King was right vain.
    All this Marian told in\r\ndetail, and added:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I heard Her Majesty
    say she desired to see you, I asked leave\r\nto go in search of you, saying I
    had known you once. And the Queen was\r\nright glad, and bade me go, and sent
    this gold ring to you from off her\r\nfinger, in token of her faith.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    Robin took the ring and bowed his head and kissed it loyally. \u201CBy\r\nthis
    token will I go to London town,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand ere I part with\r\nthe
    Queen\u2019s pledge, may the hand that bears it be stricken off at the\r\nwrist!\u201D
    By this time they were come to the grove before the cave,\r\nand Robin presented
    Maid Marian to the band, who treated her with the\r\ngreatest respect. Will Scarlet
    was especially delighted to greet again\r\nhis old time friend, while Allan-a-Dale
    and his good wife bustled about\r\nto make her welcome in their tiny thatched
    cottage.\r\n\r\nThat evening after they had supped royally upon the very hart
    that\r\nMarian had slain, Allan sang sweet songs of Northern minstrelsy to the\r\nfair
    guest as she sat by Robin\u2019s side, the golden arrow gleaming in\r\nher dark
    hair. The others all joined in the chorus, from Will Scarlet\u2019s\r\nbaritone
    to Friar Tuck\u2019s heavy bass. Even Little John essayed to sing,\r\nalthough
    looked at threateningly by Much the miller\u2019s son.\r\n\r\nThen Robin bade
    Marian repeat her message from the Queen, which Marian\r\ndid in a way befitting
    the dignity of her royal mistress. After which\r\nthe yeomen gave three cheers
    for the Queen and three more for her page,\r\nand drank toasts to them both,
    rising to their feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CYe have heard,\u201D quoth Robin standing
    forth, \u201Chow that Her Majesty--whom\r\nGod preserve!--wishes but four men
    to go with me. Wherefore, I choose\r\nLittle John and Will Stutely, my two lieutenants,
    Will Scarlet, my\r\ncousin, and Allan-a-Dale, my minstrel. Mistress Dale, also,
    can go with\r\nher husband and be company for the Queen\u2019s page. We will
    depart with\r\nearly morning, decked in our finest. So stir ye, my lads! and
    see that\r\nnot only your tunics are fresh, but your swords bright and your bows\r\nand
    arrows fit. For we must be a credit to the Queen as well as the good\r\ngreenwood.
    You, Much, with Stout Will, Lester, and John, the widow\u2019s\r\nthree sons,
    shall have command of the band while we are away; and Friar\r\nTuck shall preside
    over the needs of your souls and stomachs.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe orders were received
    with shouts of approval, and toasts all around\r\nwere drunk again in nut-brown
    ale, ere the company dispersed to rest\r\nafter making ready for the journey.\r\n\r\nThe
    next morning was as fine a summer\u2019s day as ever you want to see, and\r\nthe
    green leaves of the forest made a pleasing background for the gay\r\npicture
    of the yeomen setting forth. Says the old ballad--it was a\r\nseemly sight to
    see how Robin Hood himself had dressed, and all his\r\nyeomanry. He clothed his
    men in Lincoln green, and himself in scarlet\r\nred, with hats of black and feathers
    white to bravely deck each head.\r\nNor were the two ladies behind-hand, I ween,
    at the bedecking.\r\n\r\nThus the chosen party of seven sallied forth being accompanied
    to the\r\nedge of the wood by the whole band, who gave them a merry parting and\r\nGodspeed!\r\n\r\nThe
    journey to London town was made without incident. The party\r\nproceeded boldly
    along the King\u2019s highroad, and no man met them who was\r\ndisposed to say
    them nay. Besides, the good Queen\u2019s warrant and ring\r\nwould have answered
    for them, as indeed it did at the gates of London.\r\nSo on they sped and in
    due course came to the palace itself and awaited\r\naudience with the Queen.\r\n\r\nNow
    the King had gone that day to Finsbury Field, where the tourney was\r\nsoon to
    be held, in order to look over the lists and see some of his\r\npicked men whom
    he expected to win against all comers. So much had he\r\nboasted of these men,
    that the Queen had secretly resolved to win a\r\nwager of him. She had heard
    of the fame of Robin Hood and his yeomen, as\r\nMarian had said; and Marian on
    her part had been overjoyed to be able to\r\nadd a word in their favor and to
    set out in search of them.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Queen sat in her private audience-room
    chatting pleasantly\r\nwith her ladies, when in came Mistress Marian Fitzwalter
    attired again\r\nas befitted her rank of lady-in-waiting. She courtesied low
    to the Queen\r\nand awaited permission to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow now!\u201D
    said the Queen smiling; \u201Cis this my lady Marian, or the page,\r\nRichard
    Partington?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBoth, an it please Your Majesty. Richard found
    the man you sought,\r\nwhile Marian brought him to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere
    is he?\u201D asked Queen Eleanor eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201CAwaiting your audience--he
    and four of his men, likewise a lady of\r\nwhose wooing and wedding I can tell
    you a pretty story at another time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave them admitted.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    Marian gave orders to a herald, and presently Robin Hood and his\r\nlittle party
    entered the room.\r\n\r\nNow the Queen had half-expected the men to be rude and
    uncouth in\r\nappearance, because of their wild life in the forest; but she was\r\ndelightfully
    disappointed. Indeed she started back in surprise and\r\nalmost clapped her hands.
    For, sooth to say, the yeomen made a brave\r\nsight, and in all the court no
    more gallant men could be found. Marian\r\nfelt her cheeks glow with pride, at
    sight of the half-hidden looks of\r\nadmiration sent forth by the other ladies-in-waiting.\r\n\r\nRobin
    had not forgot the gentle arts taught by his mother, and he wore\r\nhis fine
    red velvet tunic and breeches with the grace of a courtier.\r\nWe have seen,
    before, what a dandified gentleman Will Scarlet was; and\r\nAllan-a-Dale, the
    minstrel, was scarcely less goodly to look upon.\r\nWhile the giant Little John
    and broad-shouldered Will Stutely made up in\r\nstature what little they lacked
    in outward polish. Mistress Dale, on her\r\npart, looked even more charming,
    if possible, than on the momentous day\r\nwhen she went to Plympton Church to
    marry one man and found another.\r\n\r\nThus came the people of the greenwood
    before Queen Eleanor, in her own\r\nprivate audience room. And Robin advanced
    and knelt down before her, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\u201CHere I am, Robin Hood--I
    and my chosen men! At Your Majesty\u2019s bidding\r\nam I come, bearing the ring
    of amnesty which I will protect--as I would\r\nprotect Your Majesty\u2019s honor--with
    my life!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThou art welcome, Lockesley,\u201D said the Queen
    smiling graciously.\r\n\r\n\u201CThou art come in good time, thou and all thy
    brave yeomanry.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Robin presented each of his men in turn, and
    each fell on his\r\nknee and was greeted with most kindly words. And the Queen
    kissed fair\r\nMistress Dale upon the cheek, and bade her remain in the palace
    with her\r\nladies while she was in the city. And she made all the party be seated\r\nto
    rest themselves after their long journey. Fine wines were brought,\r\nand cake,
    and rich food, for their refreshment. And as they ate and\r\ndrank, the Queen
    told them further of the tourney to be held at Finsbury\r\nField, and of how
    she desired them to wear her colors and shoot for her.\r\nMeantime, she concluded,
    they were to lie by quietly and be known of no\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTo do all this,
    Robin and his men pledged themselves full heartily. Then\r\nat the Queen\u2019s
    request, they related to her and her ladies some of their\r\nmerry adventures;
    whereat the listeners were vastly entertained, and\r\nlaughed heartily. Then
    Marian, who had heard of the wedding at Plympton\r\nChurch, told it so drolly
    that tears stood in the Queen\u2019s eyes from\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    lord Bishop of Hereford!\u201D she said, \u201C\u2018Twas indeed a comical business\r\nfor
    him! I shall keep that to twit his bones, I promise you! So this is\r\nour minstrel?\u201D
    she added presently, turning to Allan-a-Dale. \u201CMethinks I\r\nhave already
    heard of him. Will he not harp awhile for us to-day?\u201D\r\n\r\nAllan bowed
    low, and took a harp which was brought to him, and he\r\nthrummed the strings
    and sang full sweetly the border songs of the North\r\nCountree. And the Queen
    and all her ladies listened in rapt silence till\r\nall the songs were ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE OUTLAWS SHOT IN KING HARRY\u2019S TOURNEY\r\n\r\n     The
    King is into Finsbury Field\r\n     Marching in battle \u2018ray,\r\n     And
    after follows bold Robin Hood,\r\n     And all his yeomen gay.\r\n\r\nThe morning
    of the great archery contest dawned fair and bright,\r\nbringing with it a fever
    of impatience to every citizen of London town,\r\nfrom the proudest courtier
    to the lowest kitchen wench. Aye, and all the\r\nsurrounding country was early
    awake, too, and began to wend their way to\r\nFinsbury Field, a fine broad stretch
    of practice ground near Moorfields.\r\nAround three sides of the Field were erected
    tier upon tier of seats,\r\nfor the spectators, with the royal boxes and booths
    for the nobility\r\nand gentry in the center. Down along one end were pitched
    gaily colored\r\ntents for the different bands of King\u2019s archers. There
    were ten of\r\nthese bands, each containing a score of men headed by a captain
    of great\r\nrenown; so to-day there were ten of the pavilions, each bearing aloft\r\nthe
    Royal Arms and vari-colored pennants which fluttered lightly in the\r\nfresh
    morning breeze.\r\n\r\nEach captain\u2019s flag was of peculiar color and device.
    First came the\r\nroyal purple streamer of Tepus, own bow-bearer to the King,
    and esteemed\r\nthe finest archer in all the land. Then came the yellow of Clifton
    of\r\nBuckinghamshire; and the blue of Gilbert of the White Hand--he who was\r\nrenowned
    in Nottinghamshire; and the green of Elwyn the Welshman; and\r\nthe White of
    Robert of Cloudesdale; and, after them, five other captains\r\nof bands, each
    a man of proved prowess. As the Queen had said aforetime,\r\nthe King was mightily
    proud of his archers, and now held this tourney to\r\nshow their skill and, mayhap,
    to recruit their forces.\r\n\r\nThe uprising tiers of seats filled early, upon
    this summer morning, and\r\nthe merry chatter of the people went abroad like
    the hum of bees in a\r\nhive. The royal party had not yet put in an appearance,
    nor were any\r\nof the King\u2019s archers visible. So the crowd was content
    to hide its\r\nimpatience by laughing jibes passed from one section to another,
    and\r\ncrying the colors of their favorite archers. In and out among the seats\r\nwent
    hawkers, their arms laden with small pennants to correspond with\r\nthe rival
    tents. Other vendors of pie and small cakes and cider also did\r\na thrifty business,
    for so eager had some of the people been to get good\r\nseats, that they had
    rushed away from home without their breakfast.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the gates at the
    far end, next the tents, opened wide, and a\r\ncourier in scarlet and gold, mounted
    upon a white horse, rode in\r\nblowing lustily upon the trumpet at his lips;
    and behind him came six\r\nstandard-bearers riding abreast. The populace arose
    with a mighty cheer.\r\nKing Harry had entered the arena. He bestrode a fine
    white charger\r\nand was clad in a rich dark suit of slashed velvet with satin
    and gold\r\nfacings. His hat bore a long curling ostrich plume of pure white
    and he\r\ndoffed it graciously in answer to the shouts of the people. By his\r\nside
    rode Queen Eleanor, looking regal and charming in her long brocade\r\nriding-habit;
    while immediately behind them came Prince Richard and\r\nPrince John, each attired
    in knightly coats of mail and helmets. Lords\r\nand ladies of the realm followed;
    and finally, the ten companies of\r\narchers, whose progress round the field
    was greeted with hardly less\r\napplause than that given the King himself.\r\n\r\nThe
    King and Queen dismounted from their steeds, ascended the steps\r\nof the royal
    box, and seated themselves upon two thrones, decked with\r\npurple and gold trapping,
    upon a dais sheltered by striped canvas. In\r\nthe booths at each side the members
    of the Court took their places;\r\nwhile comely pages ran hither and thither
    bearing the royal commands.\r\n\u2018Twas a lordly sight, I ween, this shifting
    of proud courtiers, flashing\r\nof jeweled fans, and commingling of bright colors
    with costly gems!\r\n\r\nNow the herald arose to command peace, and soon the
    clear note of his\r\nbugle rose above the roar of the crowd and hushed it to
    silence. The\r\ntenscore archers ranged themselves in two long rows on each side
    of\r\nthe lists--a gallant array--while their captains, as a special mark of\r\nfavor,
    stood near the royal box.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome hither, Tepus,\u201D said the King
    to his bow-bearer. \u201CCome, measure me\r\nout this line, how long our mark
    must be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is the reward?\u201D then asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    will the herald presently proclaim,\u201D answered the King. \u201CFor first\r\nprize
    we have offered a purse containing twoscore golden pounds; for\r\nsecond, a purse
    containing twoscore silver pennies; and for third a\r\nsilver bugle, inlaid with
    gold. Moreover, if the King\u2019s companies keep\r\nthese prizes, the winning
    companies shall have, first, two tuns of\r\nRhenish wine; second, two tuns of
    English beer; and, third, five of\r\nthe fattest harts that run on Dallom Lea.
    Methinks that is a princely\r\nwager,\u201D added King Harry laughingly.\r\n\r\nUp
    spake bold Clifton, secure in the King\u2019s favor. \u201CMeasure no marks for\r\nus,
    most sovereign liege,\u201D quoth he; \u201Cfor such largess as that, we\u2019ll\r\nshoot
    at the sun and the moon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Twill not be so far as that,\u201D
    said the King. \u201CBut get a line of good\r\nlength, Tepus, and set up the
    targets at tenscore paces.\u201D\r\n\r\nForthwith, Tepus bowed low, and set up
    ten targets, each bearing the\r\npennant of a different company, while the herald
    stood forth again and\r\nproclaimed the rules and prizes. The entries were open
    to all comers.\r\nEach man, also, of the King\u2019s archers should shoot three
    arrows at the\r\ntarget bearing the colors of his band, until the best bowman
    in each\r\nband should be chosen. These ten chosen archers should then enter
    a\r\ncontest for an open target--three shots apiece--and here any other\r\nbowman
    whatsoever was asked to try his skill. The result at the open\r\ntargets should
    decide the tourney.\r\n\r\nThen all the people shouted again, in token that the
    terms of the\r\ncontest pleased them; and the archers waved their bows aloft,
    and\r\nwheeled into position facing their respective targets.\r\n\r\nThe shooting
    now began, upon all the targets at once, and the multitude\r\nhad so much ado
    to watch them, that they forgot to shout. Besides,\r\nsilence was commanded during
    the shooting. Of all the fine shooting that\r\nmorning, I have not now space
    to tell you. The full score of men shot\r\nthree times at each target, and then
    three times again to decide a tie.\r\nFor, more than once, the arrow shot by
    one man would be split wide\r\nopen by his successor. Every man\u2019s shaft
    bore his number to ease the\r\ncounting; and so close would they stick at the
    end of a round, that the\r\ntarget looked like a big bristle hairbrush. Then
    must the spectators\r\nrelieve their tense spirits by great cheering; while the
    King looked\r\nmighty proud of his skilled bowmen.\r\n\r\nAt last the company
    targets were decided, and Tepus, as was expected,\r\nled the score, having made
    six exact centers in succession. Gilbert\r\nof the White Hand followed with five,
    and Clifton with four. Two other\r\ncaptains had touched their center four times,
    but not roundly. While in\r\nthe other companies it so chanced that the captains
    had been out-shot by\r\nsome of the men under them.\r\n\r\nThe winners then saluted
    the King and Queen, and withdrew for a space to\r\nrest and renew their bow-strings
    for the keenest contest of all; while\r\nthe lists were cleared and a new target--the
    open one--was set up at\r\ntwelvescore paces. At the bidding of the King, the
    herald announced\r\nthat the open target was to be shot at, to decide the title
    of the best\r\narcher in all England; and any man there present was privileged
    to try\r\nfor it. But so keen had been the previous shooting, that many yeomen
    who\r\nhad come to enter the lists now would not do so; and only a dozen men\r\nstepped
    forth to give in their names.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy my halidom!\u201D said the King,
    \u201Cthese must be hardy men to pit\r\nthemselves against my archers!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThink
    you that your ten chosen fellows are the best bowmen in all\r\nEngland?\u201D
    asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, and in all the world beside,\u201D answered
    the King; \u201Cand thereunto I\r\nwould stake five hundred pounds.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am minded to take your wager,\u201D said the Queen musingly, \u201Cand will\r\ne\u2019en
    do so if you grant me a boon.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D asked the
    King.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I produce five archers who can out-shoot your ten, will
    you grant my\r\nmen full grace and amnesty?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAssuredly!\u201D
    quoth the King in right good humor. \u201CNathless, I tell you\r\nnow, your wager
    is in jeopardy, for there never were such bowmen as\r\nTepus and Clifton and
    Gilbert!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHum!\u201D said the Queen puckering her brow, still
    as though lost in\r\nthought. \u201CI must see if there be none present to aid
    me in my wager.\r\nBoy, call hither Sir Richard of the Lea and my lord Bishop
    of Hereford!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe two summoned ones, who had been witnessing the
    sport, came forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir Richard,\u201D said she, \u201Cthou art
    a full knight and good. Would\u2019st\r\nadvise me to meet a wager of the King\u2019s,
    that I can produce other\r\narchers as good as Tepus and Gilbert and Clifton?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    Your Majesty,\u201D he said, bending his knee. \u201CThere be none present\r\nthat
    can match them. Howbeit,\u201D--he added dropping his voice--\u201CI have\r\nheard
    of some who lie hid in Sherwood Forest who could show them strange\r\ntargets.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Queen smiled and dismissed him.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome hither, my lord Bishop of Hereford,\u201D
    quoth she, \u201Cwould\u2019st thou\r\nadvance a sum to support my wager \u2018gainst
    the King?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, Your Majesty,\u201D said the fat Bishop, \u201Can
    you pardon me, I\u2019d not lay\r\ndown a penny on such a bet. For by my silver
    mitre, the King\u2019s archers\r\nare men who have no peers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    suppose I found men whom _thou knewest_ to be masters at the bow,\u201D\r\n she
    insisted roguishly, \u201Cwould\u2019st thou not back them? Belike, I have\r\nheard
    that there be men round about Nottingham and Plympton who carry\r\nsuch matters
    with a high hand!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Bishop glanced nervously around, as if half
    expecting to see Robin\r\nHood\u2019s men standing near; then turned to find
    the Queen looking at him\r\nwith much amusement lurking in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201COdds
    bodikins! The story of my misadventure must have preceded me!\u201D he\r\nthought,
    ruefully. Aloud he said, resolved to face it out,\r\n\r\n\u201CYour Majesty,
    such tales are idle and exaggerated. An you pardon me, I\r\nwould add to the
    King\u2019s wager that his men are invincible.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAs it pleases
    thee,\u201D replied the Queen imperturbably. \u201CHow much?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHere
    is my purse,\u201D said the Bishop uneasily. \u201CIt contains fifteen score\r\nnobles,
    or near a hundred pounds.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll take it at even money,\u201D
    she said, dismissing him; \u201Cand Your\r\nMajesty\u201D--turning to the King
    who had been conversing with the two\r\nprinces and certain of the nobles--\u201CI
    accept your wager of five hundred\r\npounds.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery good,\u201D
    said the King, laughing as though it were a great jest.\r\n\u201CBut what had
    minded you to take such interest in the sport, of a\r\nsudden?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is as I have said. I have found five men whom I will pit against any\r\nyou may
    produce.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen we will try their skill speedily,\u201D quoth
    the King. \u201CHow say you,\r\nif first we decide this open target and then
    match the five best thereat\r\nagainst your unknown champions?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAgreed,\u201D
    said the Queen. Thereupon she signed to Maid Marian to\r\nstep forward, from
    a near-by booth where she sat with other\r\nladies-in-waiting, and whispered
    something in her ear. Marian courtesied\r\nand withdrew.\r\n\r\nNow the ten chosen
    archers from the King\u2019s bands came forth again and\r\ntook their stand;
    and with them stood forth the twelve untried men from\r\nthe open lists. Again
    the crowd was stilled, and every eye hung upon the\r\nspeeding of the shafts.
    Slowly but skilfully each man shot, and as\r\nhis shaft struck within the inner
    ring a deep breath broke from the\r\nmultitude like the sound of the wind upon
    the seashore. And now Gilbert\r\nof the White Hand led the shooting, and \u2018twas
    only by the space of a\r\nhairsbreadth upon the line that Tepus tied his score.
    Stout Elwyn, the\r\nWelshman, took third place; one of the private archers, named
    Geoffrey,\r\ncome fourth; while Clifton must needs content himself with fifth.\r\n\r\nThe
    men from the open lists shot fairly true, but nervousness and fear\r\nof ridicule
    wrought their undoing.\r\n\r\nThe herald then came forward again, and, instead
    of announcing the\r\nprize-winners, proclaimed that there was to be a final contest.
    Two\r\nmen had tied for first place, declared His Majesty the King, and three\r\nothers
    were entitled to honors. Now all these five were to shoot\r\nagain, and they
    were to be pitted against five other of the Queen\u2019s\r\nchoosing--men who
    had not yet shot upon that day.\r\n\r\nA thrill of astonishment and excitement
    swept around the arena. \u201CWho\r\nwere these men of the Queen\u2019s choosing?\u201D
    was upon every lip. The hubbub\r\nof eager voices grew intense; and in the midst
    of it all, the gate at\r\nthe far end of the field opened and five men entered
    and escorted a lady\r\nupon horseback across the arena to the royal box. The
    lady was instantly\r\nrecognized as Mistress Marian of the Queen\u2019s household,
    but no one\r\nseemed to know the faces of her escort. Four were clad in Lincoln
    green,\r\nwhile the fifth, who seemed to be the leader, was dressed in a brave\r\nsuit
    of scarlet red. Each man wore a close fitting cap of black, decked\r\nwith a
    curling white feather. For arms, they carried simply a stout bow,\r\na sheaf
    of new arrows, and a short hunting-knife.\r\n\r\nWhen the little party came before
    the dais on which the King and Queen\r\nsat, the yeomen doffed their caps humbly,
    while Maid Marian was assisted\r\nto dismount.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour Gracious Majesty,\u201D
    she said, addressing the Queen, \u201Cthese be the\r\nmen for whom you sent me,
    and who are now come to wear your colors and\r\nservice you in the tourney.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Queen leaned forward and handed them each a scarf of green and gold.\r\n\r\n\u201CLockesley,\u201D
    she said in a clear voice, \u201CI thank thee and thy men for\r\nthis service.
    Know that I have laid a wager with the King that ye can\r\noutshoot the best
    five whom he has found in all his bowmen.\u201D The five\r\nmen pressed the scarfs
    to their lips in token of fealty.\r\n\r\nThe King turned to the Queen inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    are these men you have brought before us?\u201D asked he.\r\n\r\nUp came the
    worthy Bishop of Hereford, growing red and pale by turns.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour pardon,
    my liege lord!\u201D cried he; \u201CBut I must denounce these\r\nfellows as
    outlaws. Yon man in scarlet is none other than Robin Hood\r\nhimself. The others
    are Little John and Will Stutely and Will Scarlet\r\nand Allan-a-Dale--all famous
    in the North Countree for their deeds of\r\nviolence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAs my
    lord Bishop personally knows!\u201D added the Queen significantly.\r\n\r\nThe
    King\u2019s brows grew dark. The name of Robin Hood was well known to\r\nhim,
    as to every man there present.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs this true?\u201D he demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    my lord,\u201D responded the Queen demurely. \u201CBut, bethink you--I have\r\nyour
    royal promise of grace and amnesty.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I keep,\u201D
    said the King, holding in check his ire by a mighty\r\neffort. \u201CBut, look
    you! Only forty days do I grant of respite. When this\r\ntime has elapsed, let
    these bold outlaws look to their safety!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen turning to his five
    victorious archers, who had drawn near, he\r\nadded, \u201CYe have heard, my
    men, how that I have a wager with the Queen\r\nupon your prowess. Now here be
    men of her choosing--certain free shafts\r\nof Sherwood and Barnesdale. Wherefore
    look well to it, Gilbert and Tepus\r\nand Geoffrey and Elwyn and Clifton! If
    ye outshoot these knaves, I will\r\nfill your caps with silver pennies--aye,
    and knight the man who stands\r\nfirst. But if ye lose, I give the prizes, for
    which ye have just\r\nstriven, to Robin Hood and his men, according to my royal
    word.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRobin Hood and his men!\u201D the saying flew round
    the arena with the speed\r\nof wild-fire, and every neck craned forward to see
    the famous fellows\r\nwho had dared to brave the King\u2019s anger, because of
    the Queen.\r\n\r\nAnother target was now set up, at the same distance as the
    last, and\r\nit was decided that the ten archers should shoot three arrows in
    turn.\r\nGilbert and Robin tossed up a penny for the lead, and it fell to the\r\nKing\u2019s
    men. So Clifton was bidden to shoot first.\r\n\r\nForth he stood, planting his
    feet firmly, and wetting his fingers before\r\nplucking the string. For he was
    resolved to better his losing score of\r\nthat day. And in truth he did so, for
    the shaft he loosed sped true, and\r\nlanded on the black bull\u2019s-eye, though
    not in the exact center. Again he\r\nshot, and again he hit the black, on the
    opposite rim. The third shaft\r\nswerved downward and came within the second
    ring, some two fingers\u2019\r\nbreadths away. Nathless, a general cry went up,
    as this was the best\r\nshooting Clifton had done that day.\r\n\r\nWill Scarlet
    was chosen to follow him, and now took his place and\r\ncarefully chose three
    round and full-feathered arrows.\r\n\r\n\u201CCareful, my sweet coz!\u201D quoth
    Robin in a low tone. \u201CThe knave has left\r\nwide space at the center for
    all of your darts.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Robin gave Will the wrong caution, for over-much
    care spoiled\r\nhis aim. His first shaft flew wide and lodged in the second ring
    even\r\nfurther away than the worst shot of Clifton.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour pardon,
    coz!\u201D quoth Robin hastily. \u201CBid care go to the bottom of\r\nthe sea,
    and do you loose your string before it sticks to your fingers!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    Will profited by this hint, and loosed his next two shafts as\r\nfreely as though
    they flew along a Sherwood glade. Each struck upon the\r\nbull\u2019s-eye, and
    one even nearer the center than his rival\u2019s mark. Yet\r\nthe total score
    was adjudged in favor of Clifton. At this Will Scarlet\r\nbit his lip, but said
    no word, while the crowd shouted and waved yellow\r\nflags for very joy that
    the King\u2019s man had overcome the outlaw. They\r\nknew, also, that this demonstration
    would please the King.\r\n\r\nThe target was now cleared for the next two contestants--Geoffrey
    and\r\nAllan-a-Dale. Whereat, it was noticed that many ladies in the Queen\u2019s\r\nbooths
    boldly flaunted Allan\u2019s colors, much to the honest pride which\r\nglowed
    in the cheeks of one who sat in their midst.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn good truth,\u201D
    said more than one lady to Mistress Dale, \u201Cif thy\r\nhusband can handle
    the longbow as skilfully as the harp, his rival has\r\nlittle show of winning!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    saying augured well. Geoffrey had shot many good shafts that day;\r\nand indeed
    had risen from the ranks by virtue of them. But now each of\r\nhis three shots,
    though well placed in triangular fashion around the rim\r\nof the bull\u2019s-eye,
    yet allowed an easy space for Allan to graze within.\r\nHis shooting, moreover,
    was so prettily done, that he was right heartily\r\napplauded--the ladies and
    their gallants leading in the hand-clapping.\r\n\r\nNow you must know that there
    had long been a friendly rivalry in Robin\r\nHood\u2019s band as to who was the
    best shot, next after Robin himself. He\r\nand Will Stutely had lately decided
    their marksmanship, and Will had\r\nfound that Robin\u2019s skill was now so
    great as to place the leader at the\r\nhead of all good bowmen in the forest.
    But the second place lay between\r\nLittle John and Stutely, and neither wished
    to yield to the other. So\r\nto-day they looked narrowly at their leader to see
    who should shoot\r\nthird. Robin read their faces at a glance, and laughing merrily,
    broke\r\noff two straws and held them out.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe long straw goes next!\u201D
    he decided; and it fell to Stutely.\r\n\r\nElwyn the Welshman was to precede
    him; and his score was no whit better\r\nthan Geoffrey\u2019s. But Stutely failed
    to profit by it. His besetting sin\r\nat archery had ever been an undue haste
    and carelessness. To-day these\r\nwere increased by a certain moodiness, that
    Little John had outranked\r\nhim. So his first two shafts flew swiftly, one after
    the other, to\r\nlodging places outside the Welshman\u2019s mark.\r\n\r\n\u201CMan!
    man!\u201D cried Robin entreatingly, \u201Cyou do forget the honor of the\r\nQueen,
    and the credit of Sherwood!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI ask your pardon, master!\u201D
    quoth Will humbly enough, and loosing as he\r\nspoke his last shaft. It whistled
    down the course unerringly and struck\r\nin the exact center--the best shot yet
    made.\r\n\r\nNow some shouted for Stutely and some shouted for Elwyn; but Elwyn\u2019s\r\ntotal
    mark was declared the better. Whereupon the King turned to the\r\nQueen. \u201CWhat
    say you now?\u201D quoth he in some triumph. \u201CTwo out of the\r\nthree first
    rounds have gone to my men. Your outlaws will have to shoot\r\nbetter than that
    in order to save your wager!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Queen smiled gently.\r\n\r\n\u201CYea,
    my lord,\u201D she said. \u201CBut the twain who are left are able to do the\r\nshooting.
    You forget that I still have Little John and Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    you forget, my lady, that I still have Tepus and Gilbert.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo each
    turned again to the lists and awaited the next rounds in silent\r\neagerness.
    I ween that King Harry had never watched the invasion of an\r\nenemy with more
    anxiety than he now felt.\r\n\r\nTepus was chosen to go next and he fell into
    the same error with Will\r\nScarlet. He held the string a moment too long, and
    both his first and\r\nsecond arrows came to grief. One of them, however, came
    within the black\r\nrim, and he followed it up by placing his third in the full
    center,\r\njust as Stutely had done in his last. These two centers were the fairest\r\nshots
    that had been made that day; and loud was the applause which\r\ngreeted this
    second one. But the shouting was as nothing to the uproar\r\nwhich followed Little
    John\u2019s shooting. That good-natured giant seemed\r\ndetermined to outdo Tepus
    by a tiny margin in each separate shot; for\r\nthe first and the second shafts
    grazed his rival\u2019s on the inner side,\r\nwhile for the third Little John
    did the old trick of the forest: he\r\nshot his own arrow in a graceful curve
    which descended from above upon\r\nTepus\u2019s final center shaft with a glancing
    blow that drove the other out\r\nand left the outlaw\u2019s in its place.\r\n\r\nThe
    King could scarce believe his eyes. \u201CBy my halidom!\u201D quoth he, \u201Cthat\r\nfellow
    deserves either a dukedom or a hanging! He must be in league with\r\nSatan himself!
    Never saw I such shooting.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe score is tied, my lord,\u201D
    said the Queen; \u201Cwe have still to see\r\nGilbert and Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\nGilbert
    now took his stand and slowly shot his arrows, one after\r\nanother, into the
    bull\u2019s-eye. \u2018Twas the best shooting he had yet\r\ndone, but there was
    still the smallest of spaces left--if you looked\r\nclosely--at the very center.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell
    done, Gilbert!\u201D spoke up Robin Hood. \u201CYou are a foeman worthy of\r\nbeing
    shot against.\u201D He took his own place as he spoke. \u201CNow if you had\r\nplaced
    one of your shafts _there_\u201D--loosing one of his own--\u201Cand another\r\n_there_\u201D--out
    sped the second--\u201Cand another _there_\u201D--the third was\r\nlaunched--\u201Cmayhap
    the King would have declared you the best bowman in\r\nall England!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    the last part of his merry speech was drowned in the wild tumult\r\nof applause
    which followed his exploit. His first two shafts had packed\r\nthemselves into
    the small space left at the bull\u2019s-eye; while his third\r\nhad split down
    between them, taking half of each, and making all three\r\nappear from a distance,
    as one immense arrow.\r\n\r\nUp rose the King in amazement and anger.\r\n\r\n\u201CGilbert
    is not yet beaten!\u201D he cried. \u201CDid he not shoot within the mark\r\nthrice?
    And that is allowed a best in all the rules of archery.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin bowed
    low.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs it please Your Majesty!\u201D quoth he. \u201CBut may I
    be allowed to place\r\nthe mark for the second shooting?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe King
    waved his hand sullenly.. Thereupon Robin prepared another old\r\ntrick of the
    greenwood, and got him a light, peeled willow wand which he\r\nset in the ground
    in place of the target.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere, friend Gilbert,\u201D called he gaily;
    \u201Cbelike you can hit that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can scarce see it from here,\u201D
    said Gilbert, \u201Cmuch less hit it.\r\nNathless, for the King\u2019s honor,
    I will try.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut this final shot proved his undoing, and his shaft
    flew harmlessly\r\nby the thin white streak. Then came Robin to his stand again,
    and picked\r\nhis arrow with exceeding care, and tried his string. Amid a breathless\r\npause
    he drew the good yew bow back to his ear, glanced along the shaft,\r\nand let
    the feathered missile fly. Straight it sped, singing a keen note\r\nof triumph
    as it went. The willow wand was split in twain, as though it\r\nhad met a hunter\u2019s
    knife.\r\n\r\n\u201CVerily, I think your bow is armed with witchcraft!\u201D
    cried Gilbert. \u201CFor\r\nI did not believe such shooting possible.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    should come to see our merry lads in the greenwood,\u201D retorted Robin\r\nlightly.
    \u201CFor willow wands do not grow upon the cobblestones of London\r\ntown.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeanwhile
    the King in great wrath had risen to depart, first signing the\r\njudges to distribute
    the prizes. Never a word said he, of good or\r\nill, to the Queen, but mounted
    his horse and, followed by his sons and\r\nknights, rode off the field. The archers
    dropped upon one knee as he\r\npassed, but he gave them a single baleful look
    and was gone.\r\n\r\nThen the Queen beckoned the outlaws to approach, and they
    did so and\r\nknelt at her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CRight well have ye served me,\u201D
    she said, \u201Cand sorry am I that the\r\nKing\u2019s anger is aroused thereby.
    But fear ye not. His word and grace\r\nhold true. As to these prizes ye have
    gained, I add others of mine\r\nown--the wagers I have won from His Majesty the
    King and from the lord\r\nBishop of Hereford. Buy with some of these moneys the
    best swords ye\r\ncan find in London, for all your band, and call them the swords
    of the\r\nQueen. And swear with them to protect all the poor and the helpless
    and\r\nthe women--kind who come your way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe swear,\u201D
    said the five yeomen solemnly.\r\n\r\nThen the Queen gave each of them her hand
    to kiss, and arose and\r\ndeparted with all her ladies. And after they were gone,
    the King\u2019s\r\narchers came crowding around Robin and his men, eager to get
    a glimpse\r\nof the fellows about whom they had heard so much. And back of them
    came\r\na great crowd of the spectators pushing and jostling in their efforts
    to\r\ncome nearer.\r\n\r\n\u201CVerily!\u201D laughed Little John, \u201Cthey
    must take us for a Merry Andrew\r\nshow!\u201D\r\n\r\nNow the judges came up,
    and announced each man his prize, according\r\nto the King\u2019s command. To
    Robin was give the purse containing twoscore\r\ngolden pounds; to Little John
    the twoscore silver pennies; and to\r\nAllan-a-Dale the fine inlaid bugle, much
    to his delight, for he was\r\nskilled at blowing sweet tunes upon the horn hardly
    less than handling\r\nthe harp strings. But when the Rhenish wine and English
    beer and harts\r\nof Dallom Lea were spoken of, Robin said:\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    what need we of wine or beer, so far from the greenwood? And\r\n\u2018twould
    be like carrying coals to Newcastle, to drive those harts to\r\nSherwood! Now
    Gilbert and Tepus and their men have shot passing well.\r\nWherefore, the meat
    and drink must go to them, an they will accept it of\r\nus.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRight
    gladly,\u201D replied Gilbert grasping his hand. \u201CYe are good men\r\nall,
    and we will toast you every one, in memory of the greatest day at\r\narchery
    that England has ever seen, or ever will see!\u201D\r\n\r\nThus said all the
    King\u2019s archers, and the hand of good-fellowship was\r\ngiven amid much shouting
    and clapping on the shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\nAnd so ended King Harry\u2019s tourney,
    whose story has been handed down from\r\nsire to son, even unto the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XIV\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD WAS SOUGHT OF THE TINKER\r\n\r\n     And while the
    tinker fell asleep,\r\n     Robin made haste away,\r\n     And left the tinker
    in the lurch,\r\n     For the great shot to pay.\r\n\r\nKing Henry was as good
    as his word. Robin Hood and his party were\r\nsuffered to depart from London--the
    parting bringing keen sorrow to\r\nMarian--and for forty days no hand was raised
    against them. But at\r\nthe end of that time, the royal word was sent to the
    worthy Sheriff at\r\nNottingham that he must lay hold upon the outlaws without
    further delay,\r\nas he valued his office.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the exploits of Robin
    and his band, ending with the great\r\ntourney in Finsbury Field, had made a
    mighty stir through all England,\r\nand many there were to laugh boldly at the
    Nottingham official for his\r\nfailures to capture the outlaws.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff
    thereupon planned three new expeditions into the greenwood,\r\nand was even brave
    enough to lead them, since he had fifteen-score men\r\nat his beck and call each
    time. But never the shadow of an outlaw did\r\nhe see, for Robin\u2019s men lay
    close, and the Sheriff\u2019s men knew not how to\r\ncome at their chief hiding-place
    in the cove before the cavern.\r\n\r\nNow the Sheriff\u2019s daughter had hated
    Robin Hood bitterly in her heart\r\never since the day he refused to bestow upon
    her the golden arrow, and\r\nshamed her before all the company. His tricks, also,
    upon her father\r\nwere not calculated to lessen her hatred, and so she sought
    about for\r\nmeans to aid the Sheriff in catching the enemy.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    is no need to go against this man with force of arms,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CWe
    must meet his tricks with other tricks of our own.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWould that
    we could!\u201D groaned the Sheriff. \u201CThe fellow is becoming a\r\nnightmare
    unto me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me plan a while,\u201D she replied. \u201CBelike
    I can cook up some scheme\r\nfor his undoing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAgreed,\u201D
    said the Sheriff, \u201Cand if anything comes of your planning,\r\nI will e\u2019en
    give you an hundred silver pennies for a new gown, and a\r\ndouble reward to
    the man who catches the outlaws.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow upon that same day, while the
    Sheriff\u2019s daughter was racking her\r\nbrains for a scheme, there came to
    the Mansion House a strolling tinker\r\nnamed Middle, a great gossip and braggart.
    And as he pounded away upon\r\nsome pots and pans in the scullery, he talked
    loudly about what _he_\r\nwould do, if he once came within reach of that rascal
    Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt might be that this simple fellow could do something
    through his\r\nvery simplicity,\u201D mused the Sheriff\u2019s daughter, overhearing
    his prattle.\r\n\u201COdds bodikins! \u2018twill do no harm to try his service,
    while I bethink\r\nmyself of some better plan.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd she called him
    to her, and looked him over--a big brawny fellow\r\nenough, with an honest look
    about the eye, and a countenance so open\r\nthat when he smiled his mouth seemed
    the only country on the map.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am minded to try your skill at outlaw
    catching,\u201D she said, \u201Cand will\r\nadd goodly measure to the stated
    reward if you succeed. Do you wish to\r\nmake good your boasted prowess?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    tinker grinned broadly.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, your ladyship,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen
    here is a warrant made out this morning by the Sheriff himself.\r\nSee that you
    keep it safely and use it to good advantage.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd she dismissed him.\r\n\r\nMiddle
    departed from the house mightily pleased with himself, and\r\nproud of his commission.
    He swung his crab-tree-staff recklessly in his\r\nglee--so recklessly that he
    imperiled the shins of more than one angry\r\npasser-by--and vowed he\u2019d
    crack the ribs of Robin Hood with it, though\r\nhe was surrounded by every outlaw
    in the whole greenwood.\r\n\r\nSpurred on by the thoughts of his own coming bravery,
    he left the town\r\nand proceeded toward Barnesdale. The day was hot and dusty,
    and at\r\nnoontime he paused at a wayside inn to refresh himself. He began by\r\neating
    and drinking and dozing, in turn, then sought to do all at once.\r\n\r\nMine
    host of the \u201CSeven Does\u201D stood by, discussing the eternal Robin\r\nwith
    a drover.\r\n\r\n\u201CFolk do say that my lord Sheriff has sent into Lincoln
    for more\r\nmen-at-arms and horses, and that when he has these behind him, he\u2019ll\r\nsoon
    rid the forest of these fellows.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf whom speak you?\u201D
    asked the tinker sitting up.\r\n\r\n\u201COf Robin Hood and his men,\u201D said
    the host; \u201Cbut go to sleep again. You\r\nwill never get the reward!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    why not?\u201D asked the tinker, rising with great show of dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere
    our Sheriff has failed, and the stout Guy of Gisborne, and many\r\nmore beside,
    it behoves not a mere tinker to succeed.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe tinker laid a heavy
    hand upon the innkeeper\u2019s fat shoulder, and\r\ntried to look impressive.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    is your reckoning, host, upon the table. I must e\u2019en go upon my\r\nway,
    because I have more important business than to stand here gossiping\r\nwith you.
    But be not surprised, if, the next time you see me, I shall\r\nhave with me no
    less person than Robin Hood himself!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he strode loftily out the
    door and walked up the hot white road\r\ntoward Barnesdale.\r\n\r\nHe had not
    gone above a quarter of a mile when he met a young man with\r\ncurling brown
    hair and merry eyes. The young man carried his light cloak\r\nover his arm, because
    of the heat, and was unarmed save for a light\r\nsword at his side. The newcomer
    eyed the perspiring tinker in a friendly\r\nway, and seeing he was a stout fellow
    accosted him.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-day to you!\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood-day
    to you!\u201D said the tinker; \u201Cand a morrow less heating.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,\u201D
    laughed the other. \u201CWhence come you? And know you the news?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    is the news?\u201D said the gossipy tinker, pricking up his ear; \u201CI am\r\na
    tinker by trade, Middle by name, and come from over against Banbury.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    as for the news,\u201D laughed the stranger, \u201CI hear that two tinkers\r\nwere
    set i\u2019 the stocks for drinking too much ale and beer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf
    that be all your news,\u201D retorted Middle, \u201CI can beat you clear to\r\nthe
    end of the lane.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat news have you? Seeing that you go from
    town to town, I ween you\r\ncan outdo a poor country yokel at tidings.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll
    I have to tell,\u201D said the other, \u201Cis that I am especially\r\ncommissioned\u201D--he
    felt mightily proud of these big words--\u201Cespecially\r\ncommissioned to seek
    a bold outlaw which they call Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo?\u201D said the
    other arching his brows. \u201CHow \u2018especially commissioned\u2019?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have a warrant from the Sheriff, sealed with the King\u2019s own seal, to\r\ntake
    him where I can; and if you can tell me where he is, I will e\u2019en\r\nmake
    a man of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me see the warrant,\u201D said the other,
    \u201Cto satisfy myself if it be\r\nright; and I will do the best I can to bring
    him to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will I not,\u201D replied the tinker; \u201CI
    will trust none with it.\r\nAnd if you\u2019ll not help me to come at him I must
    forsooth catch him by\r\nmyself.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he made his crab-tree-staff
    whistle shrill circles in the air.\r\n\r\nThe other smiled at the tinker\u2019s
    simplicity, and said:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe middle of the road on a hot July day is
    not a good place to talk\r\nthings over. Now if you\u2019re the man for me and
    I\u2019m the man for you, let\u2019s\r\ngo back to the inn, just beyond the bend
    of road, and quench our thirst\r\nand cool our heads for thinking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry
    come up!\u201D quoth the tinker. \u201CThat will I! For though I\u2019ve just\r\ncome
    from there, my thirst rises mightily at the sound of your voice.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    back he turned with the stranger and proceeded to the \u201CSeven Does.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    landlord arched his eyebrows silently when he saw the two come in,\r\nbut served
    them willingly.\r\n\r\nThe tinker asked for wine, and Robin for ale. The wine
    was not the most\r\ncooling drink in the cellar, nor the clearest headed. Nathless,
    the\r\ntinker asked for it, since it was expensive and the other man had\r\ninvited
    him to drink. They lingered long over their cups, Master Middle\r\nemptying one
    after another while the stranger expounded at great length\r\non the best plans
    for coming at and capturing Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nIn the end the tinker fell sound
    asleep while in the act of trying to\r\nget a tankard to his lips. Then the stranger
    deftly opened the snoring\r\nman\u2019s pouch, took out the warrant, read it,
    and put it in his own\r\nwallet. Calling mine host to him, he winked at him with
    a half smile and\r\ntold him that the tinker would pay the whole score when he
    awoke. Thus\r\nwas Master Middle left in the lurch \u201Cfor the great shot to
    pay.\u201D\r\n\r\nNathless, the stranger seemed in no great hurry. He had the
    whim to stay\r\nawhile and see what the droll tinker might do when he awoke.
    So he hid\r\nbehind a window shutter, on the outside, and awaited events.\r\n\r\nPresently
    the tinker came to himself with a prodigious yawn, and reached\r\nat once for
    another drink.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat were you saying, friend, about the best plan
    (ya-a-a-ah!) for\r\ncatching this fellow?--Hello!--where\u2019s the man gone?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    had looked around and saw no one with him at the table.\r\n\r\n\u201CHost! host!\u201D
    he shouted, \u201Cwhere is that fellow who was to pay my\r\nreckoning?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    know not,\u201D answered the landlord sharply. \u201CMayhap he left the money\r\nin
    your purse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo he didn\u2019t!\u201D roared Middle, looking
    therein. \u201CHelp! Help! I\u2019ve been\r\nrobbed! Look you, host, you are
    liable to arrest for high treason! I am\r\nhere upon the King\u2019s business,
    as I told you earlier in the day. And yet\r\nwhile I did rest under your roof,
    thinking you were an honest man (hic!)\r\nand one loving of the King, my pouch
    has been opened and many matters of\r\nstate taken from it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCease
    your bellowing!\u201D said the landlord. \u201CWhat did you lose?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh,
    many weighty matters, I do assure you. I had with me, item, a\r\nwarrant, granted
    under the hand of my lord High Sheriff of Nottingham,\r\nand sealed with the
    Kings\u2019s own seal, for the capture (hic!)--and\r\narrest--and overcoming
    of a notorious rascal, one Robin Hood of\r\nBarnesdale. Item, one crust of bread.
    Item, one lump (hic!) of solder.\r\nItem, three pieces of twine. Item, six single
    keys (hic!), useful\r\nwithal. Item, twelve silver pennies, the which I earned
    this week (hic!)\r\nin fair labor. Item--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave done with your
    items!\u201D said the host. \u201CAnd I marvel greatly to\r\nhear you speak in
    such fashion of your friend, Robin Hood of Barnesdale.\r\nFor was he not with
    you in all good-fellowship?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWh-a-at? _That_ Robin Hood?\u201D
    gasped Middle with staring eyes. \u201CWhy did\r\nyou not tell me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith,
    _I_ saw no need o\u2019 telling you! Did you not tell me the first\r\ntime you
    were here to-day, that I need not be surprised if you came back\r\nwith no less
    person than Robin Hood himself?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJesu give me pardon!\u201D
    moaned the tinker. \u201CI see it all now. He got me\r\nto drinking, and then
    took my warrant, and my pennies, and my crust--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes,\u201D
    interrupted the host. \u201CI know all about that. But pay me the\r\nscore for
    both of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I have no money, gossip. Let me go after
    that vile bag-o\u2019-bones,\r\nand I\u2019ll soon get it out of him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot
    so,\u201D replied the other. \u201CIf I waited for you to collect from Robin\r\nHood,
    I would soon close up shop.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is the account?\u201D asked
    Middle.\r\n\r\n\u201CTen shillings, just.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen take here my
    working-bag and my good hammer too; and if I light\r\nupon that knave I will
    soon come back after them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me your leathern coat as well,\u201D
    said mine host; \u201Cthe hammer and\r\nbag of tools are as naught to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGramercy!\u201D
    cried Master Middle, losing what was left of his temper.\r\n\u201CIt seems that
    I have escaped one thief only to fall into the hands of\r\nanother. If you will
    but walk with me out into the middle of the road,\r\nI\u2019ll give you such
    a crack as shall drive some honesty into your thick\r\nskull.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    are wasting your breath and my time,\u201D retorted the landlord.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive
    me your things, and get you gone after your man, speedily.\u201D\r\n\r\nMiddle
    thought this to be good advice; so he strode forth from the\r\n\u201CSeven Does\u201D
    in a black mood.\r\n\r\nEre he had gone half a mile, he saw Robin Hood walking
    demurely among\r\nthe trees a little in front of him.\r\n\r\n\u201CHo there,
    you villain!\u201D roared the tinker. \u201CStay your steps! I am\r\ndesperately
    in need of you this day!\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin turned about with a surprised face.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    knave is this?\u201D he asked gently, \u201Cwho comes shouting after me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo
    knave! no knave at all!\u201D panted the other, rushing up. \u201CBut an\r\nhonest--man--who
    would have--that warrant--and the money for drink!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, as
    I live, it is our honest tinker who was seeking Robin Hood! Did\r\nyou find him,
    gossip?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry, that did I! and I\u2019m now going to pay him
    my respects!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he plunged at him, making a sweeping stroke with
    his\r\ncrab-tree-cudgel.\r\n\r\nRobin tried to draw his sword, but could not
    do it for a moment through\r\ndodging the other\u2019s furious blows. When he
    did get it in hand, the\r\ntinker had reached him thrice with resounding thwacks.
    Then the tables\r\nwere turned, for he dashed in right manfully with his shining
    blade and\r\nmade the tinker give back again.\r\n\r\nThe greenwood rang with
    the noise of the fray. \u2018Twas steel against\r\nwood, and they made a terrible
    clattering when they came together. Robin\r\nthought at first that he could hack
    the cudgel to pieces, for his blade\r\nwas one of Toledo--finely tempered steel
    which the Queen had given him.\r\nBut the crab-tree-staff had been fired and
    hardened and seasoned by the\r\ntinker\u2019s arts until it was like a bar of
    iron--no pleasant neighbor for\r\none\u2019s ribs.\r\n\r\nRobin presently found
    this out to his sorrow. The long reach and long\r\nstick got to him when \u2018twas
    impossible for him to touch his antagonist.\r\nSo his sides began to ache sorely.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold
    your hand, tinker,\u201D he said at length. \u201CI cry a boon of you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBefore
    I do it,\u201D said the tinker, \u201CI\u2019d hang you on this tree.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    even as he spoke, Robin found the moment\u2019s grace for which he\r\nlonged;
    and immediately grasped his horn and blew the three well-known\r\nblasts of the
    greenwood.\r\n\r\n\u201CA murrain seize you!\u201D roared the tinker commencing
    afresh. \u201CUp to your\r\nold tricks again, are you? Well, I\u2019ll have time
    to finish my job, if I\r\nhurry.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Robin was quite able to hold
    his own at a pinch, and they had not\r\nexchanged many lunges and passes when
    up came Little John and Will\r\nScarlet and a score of yeomen at their heels.
    Middle was seized without\r\nceremony, while Robin sat himself down to breathe.
    \u201CWhat is the matter?\u201D\r\n quoth Little John, \u201Cthat you should
    sit so weariedly upon the highway\r\nside?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith, that rascally
    tinker yonder has paid his score well upon my\r\nhide,\u201D answered Robin ruefully.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    tinker, then,\u201D said Little John, \u201Cmust be itching for more work.\r\nFain
    would I try if he can do as much for me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COr me,\u201D said
    Will Scarlet, who like Little John was always willing to\r\nswing a cudgel.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D
    laughed Robin. \u201CBelike I could have done better, an he had given\r\nme time
    to pull a young tree up by the roots. But I hated to spoil\r\nthe Queen\u2019s
    blade upon his tough stick or no less tough hide. He had a\r\nwarrant for my
    arrest which I stole from him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAlso, item, twelve silver pennies,\u201D
    interposed the tinker, unsubdued;\r\n\u201Citem, one crust of bread, \u2018gainst
    my supper. Item, one lump of solder.\r\nItem, three pieces of twine. Item, six
    single keys. Item--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I know,\u201D quoth the merry Robin;
    \u201CI stood outside the landlord\u2019s\r\nwindow and heard you count over
    your losses. Here they are again; and\r\nthe silver pennies are turned by magic
    into gold. Here also, if you\r\nwill, is my hand.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI take it
    heartily, with the pence!\u201D cried Middle. \u201CBy my leathern coat\r\nand
    tools, which I shall presently have out of that sly host, I swear\r\nthat I never
    yet met a man I liked as well as you! An you and your\r\nmen here will take me,
    I swear I\u2019ll serve you honestly. Do you want\r\na tinker? Nay, but verily
    you must! Who else can mend and grind your\r\nswords and patch your pannikins--and
    fight, too, when occasion serve?\r\nMend your pots! mend your pa-a-ans!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    he ended his speech with the sonorous cry of his craft.\r\n\r\nBy this time the
    whole band was laughing uproariously at the tinker\u2019s\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    say you, fellows?\u201D asked Robin. \u201CWould not this tinker be a good\r\nrecruit?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    he would!\u201D answered Will Scarlet, clapping the new man on the\r\nback. \u201CHe
    will keep Friar Tuck and Much the miller\u2019s son from having the\r\nblues.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    amid great merriment and right good fellowship the outlaws shook\r\nMiddle by
    the hand, and he took oath of fealty, and thought no more of\r\nthe Sheriff\u2019s
    daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD WAS TANNED OF THE
    TANNER\r\n\r\n     In Nottingham there lived a jolly tanner,\r\n     With a hey
    down, down, a down down!\r\n     His name was Arthur-a-Bland,\r\n     There was
    ne\u2019er a squire in Nottinghamshire\r\n\r\n     Dare bid bold Arthur stand.\r\n    
    And as he went forth, in a summer\u2019s morning,\r\n     With a hey down, down,
    a down down!\r\n     To the forest of merrie Sherwood,\r\n     To view the red
    deer, that range here and there,\r\n     There met he with bold Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff\u2019s daughter bided for several days in the faint hope that she\r\nmight
    hear tidings of the prattling tinker. But never a word heard she,\r\nand she
    was forced to the conclusion that her messenger had not so much\r\nas laid eyes
    upon the outlaw. Little recked she that he was, even then,\r\ngrinding sword-points
    and sharpening arrows out in the good greenwood,\r\nwhile whistling blithely
    or chatting merrily with the good Friar Tuck.\r\n\r\nThen she bethought herself
    of another good man, one Arthur-a-Bland, a\r\ntanner who dwelt in Nottingham
    town and was far-famed in the tourneys\r\nround about. He had done some pretty
    tricks at archery, but was\r\nstrongest at wrestling and the quarter-staff. For
    three years he had\r\ncast all comers to the earth in wrestling until the famous
    Eric\r\no\u2019 Lincoln broke a rib for him in a mighty tussle. Howsoever, at\r\nquarter-staff
    he had never yet met his match; so that there was never a\r\nsquire in Nottinghamshire
    dare bid bold Arthur stand.\r\n\r\n     With a long pike-staff on his shoulder,\r\n    
    So well he could clear his way\r\n     That by two and three he made men flee\r\n    
    And none of them could stay.\r\n\r\nThus at least runs the old song which tells
    of his might.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is just the man for me!\u201D thought the Sheriff\u2019s
    daughter to\r\nherself; and she forthwith summoned him to the Mansion House and\r\ncommissioned
    him to seek out Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nThe warrant was quite to Arthur\u2019s liking,
    for he was happiest when out\r\nin the forest taking a sly peep at the King\u2019s
    deer; and now he reckoned\r\nthat he could look at them boldly, instead of by
    the rays of the moon.\r\nHe could say to any King\u2019s Forester who made bold
    to stop him: \u201CI am\r\nhere on the King\u2019s business!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGramercy!
    No more oak-bark and ditch-water and the smell of half-tanned\r\nhides to-day!\u201D
    quoth he, gaily. \u201CI shall e\u2019en see what the free air of\r\nheaven tastes
    like, when it sweeps through the open wood.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the tanner departed
    joyfully upon his errand, but much more\r\ninterested in the dun deer of the
    forest than in any two-legged rovers\r\ntherein. This interest had, in fact,
    caused the Foresters to keep a\r\nshrewd eye upon him in the past, for his tannery
    was apt to have plenty\r\nof meat in it that was more like venison than the law
    allowed. As for\r\nthe outlaws, Arthur bore them no ill-will; indeed he had felt
    a secret\r\nenvy in his heart at their free life; but he was not afraid to meet
    any\r\ntwo men who might come against him. Nathless, the Sheriff\u2019s daughter
    did\r\nnot choose a very good messenger, as you shall presently see.\r\n\r\nAway
    sped the tanner, a piece of bread and some wine in his wallet,\r\na good longbow
    and arrows slung across his shoulder, his stout\r\nquarter-staff in his hand,
    and on his head a cap of trebled raw-hide so\r\ntough that it would turn the
    edge of a broadsword. He lost no time in\r\ngetting out of the hot sun and into
    the welcome shade of the forest,\r\nwhere he stalked cautiously about seeking
    some sign of the dun deer.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced that upon that very morning
    Robin Hood had sent Little\r\nJohn to a neighboring village to buy some cloth
    of Lincoln green for new\r\nsuits for all the band. Some of the money recently
    won of the King\r\nwas being spent in this fashion, \u2018gainst the approach
    of winter. Will\r\nScarlet had been sent on a similar errand to Barnesdale some
    time\r\nbefore, if you remember, only to be chased up the hill without his\r\npurchase.
    So to-day Little John was chosen, and for sweet company\u2019s\r\nsake Robin
    went with him a part of the way until they came to the \u201CSeven\r\nDoes,\u201D
    the inn where Robin had recently played his prank upon Middle the\r\ntinker.
    Here they drank a glass of ale to refresh themselves withal,\r\nand for good
    luck; and Robin tarried a bit while Little John went on his\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\nPresently
    Robin entered the edge of the wood, when whom should he see\r\nbut Arthur-a-Bland,
    busily creeping after a graceful deer that browsed\r\nalone down the glade. \u201CNow
    by Saint George and the Dragon!\u201D quoth Robin\r\nto himself. \u201CI much
    fear that yon same fellow is a rascally poacher come\r\nafter our own and the
    King\u2019s meat!\u201D\r\n\r\nFor you must know, by a curious process of reasoning,
    Robin and his men\r\nhad hunted in the royal preserves so long that they had
    come to consider\r\nthemselves joint owners to every animal which roamed therein.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay!\u201D
    he added, \u201Cthis must be looked into! That cow-skin cap in sooth\r\nmust
    hide a scurvy varlet!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith he crept behind a tree, and
    thence to another, stalking\r\nour friend Arthur as busily as Arthur was stalking
    the deer.\r\n\r\nThis went on for quite a space, until the tanner began to come
    upon the\r\ndeer and to draw his bow in order to tickle the victim\u2019s ribs
    with a\r\ncloth-yard shaft. But just at this moment Robin unluckily trod upon
    a\r\ntwig which snapped and caused the tanner to turn suddenly.\r\n\r\nRobin
    saw that he was discovered, so he determined to put a bold face on\r\nthe matter,
    and went forward with some smart show of authority.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold!\u201D
    he cried: \u201Cstay your hand! Why, who are you, bold fellow, to\r\nrange so
    boldly here? In sooth, to be brief, ye look like a thief that\r\nhas come to
    steal the King\u2019s deer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMarry, it is scant concern of
    yours, what I look like!\u201D retorted\r\nArthur-a-Bland. \u201CWho are you,
    who speak so bravely?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shall soon find out who I am!\u201D
    quoth Robin, determining to find\r\nsome sport in the matter. \u201CI am a keeper
    of this forest. The King knows\r\nthat I am looking after his deer for him; and
    therefore we must stay\r\nyou.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you any assistants, friend?\u201D
    asked the tanner calmly. \u201CFor it is\r\nnot one man alone who can stop me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay
    truly, gossip,\u201D replied Robin. \u201CI have a good yew bow, also a right\r\nsharp
    blade at my side. Nathless I need no better assistant than a good\r\noak-graff
    like unto yours. Give me a baker\u2019s dozen of minutes with\r\nit and it shall
    pleasure me to crack that pate of yours for your\r\nsauciness!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSoftly,
    my man! Fair and softly! Big words never killed so much as a\r\nmouse--least
    of all yon deer which has got away while you were filling\r\nall the woods with
    your noisy breath. So choose your own playthings. For\r\nyour sword and your
    bow I care not a straw; nor for all your arrows to\r\nboot. If I get but a knock
    at you, \u2018twill be as much as you\u2019ll need.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by
    our Lady! Will you listen to the braggart?\u201D cried Robin in a\r\nfine rage.
    \u201CMarry, but I\u2019ll teach ye to be more mannerly!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying
    he unbuckled his belt; and, flinging his bow upon the ground\r\nhe seized hold
    of a young sapling that was growing near by. His hunting\r\nknife soon had it
    severed and lopped into shape.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow come, fellow!\u201D said Arthur-a-Bland,
    seeing that he was ready. \u201CAnd\r\nif I do not tan your hide for you in better
    shape than ever calf-skin\r\nwas turned into top-boots, may a murrain seize me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStay,\u201D
    said Robin, \u201Cmethinks my cudgel is half a foot longer than\r\nyours. I would
    have them of even length before you begin your tanning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    pass not for length,\u201D bold Arthur replied; \u201Cmy staff is long enough,\r\nas
    you will shortly find out. Eight foot and a half, and \u2018twill knock\r\ndown
    a calf\u201D--here he made it whistle in the air--\u201Cand I hope it will\r\nknock
    down you.\u201D\r\n\r\nForthwith the two men spat on their hands, laid firm hold
    upon their\r\ncudgels and began slowly circling round each other, looking for
    an\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced that Little John had fared expeditiously
    with his\r\nerrand. He had met the merchant, from whom he was wont to buy Lincoln\r\ngreen,
    coming along the road; and had made known his wants in few words.\r\nThe merchant
    readily undertook to deliver the suits by a certain day\r\nin the following month.
    So Little John, glad to get back to the cool\r\nshelter of the greenwood, hasted
    along the road lately taken by Robin.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard the sound of
    angry voices, one of which he recognized\r\nas his captain\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,
    Heaven forfend,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cthat Robin Hood has fallen into the\r\nclutches
    of a King\u2019s man! I must take a peep at this fray.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo he cautiously
    made his way from tree to tree, as Robin had done, till\r\nhe came to the little
    open space where Robin and Arthur were circling\r\nabout each other with angry
    looks, like two dogs at bay.\r\n\r\n\u201CHa! this looks interesting!\u201D muttered
    Little John to himself, for he\r\nloved a good quarter-staff bout above anything
    else in the world, and\r\nwas the best man at it in all the greenwood. And he
    crawled quietly\r\nunderneath a friendly bush--much as he had done when Robin
    undertook to\r\nteach Will Scarlet a lesson--and chuckled softly to himself and
    slapped\r\nhis thigh and prepared to watch the fight at his ease.\r\n\r\nIndeed
    it was both exciting and laughable. You would have chuckled one\r\nmoment and
    caught your breath the next, to see those two stout fellows\r\nswinging their
    sticks--each half as long again as the men were, and\r\nthick as their arm--and
    edging along sidewise, neither wishing to strike\r\nthe first blow.\r\n\r\nAt
    last Robin could no longer forbear, and his good right arm swung\r\nround like
    a flash. Ping! went the stick on the back of the other\u2019s\r\nhead, raising
    such a welt that the blood came. But the tanner did not\r\nseem to mind it at
    all, for bing! went his own staff in return, giving\r\nRobin as good as he had
    sent. Then the battle was on, and furiously it\r\nwaged. Fast fell the blows,
    but few save the first ones landed, being\r\nmet in mid-air by a counter-blow
    till the thwacking sticks sounded like\r\nthe steady roll of a kettle-drum and
    the oak--bark flew as fine as it\r\nhad ever done in Arthur-a-Bland\u2019s tannery.\r\n\r\nRound
    and round they fought, digging their heels into the ground to keep\r\nfrom slipping,
    so that you would have vowed there had been a yoke of\r\noxen ploughing a potato-patch.
    Round and round, up and down, in and\r\nout, their arms working like threshing-machines,
    went the yeoman and the\r\ntanner, for a full hour, each becoming more astonished
    every minute that\r\nthe other was such a good fellow. While Little John from
    underneath his\r\nbushy covert had much ado to keep from roaring aloud in pure
    joy.\r\n\r\nFinally Robin saw his chance and brought a full arm blow straight
    down\r\nupon the other\u2019s head with a force that would have felled a bullock.\r\nBut
    Arthur\u2019s trebled cow-skin cap here stood him in good stead: the blow\r\nglanced
    off without doing more than stunning him. Nathless, he reeled\r\nand had much
    ado to keep from falling; seeing which Robin stayed\r\nhis hand--to his own sorrow,
    for the tanner recovered his wits in a\r\nmarvelous quick space and sent back
    a sidelong blow which fairly lifted\r\nRobin off his feet and sent him tumbling
    on to the grass.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold your hand! hold your hand!\u201D roared Robin
    with what little breath\r\nhe had left. \u201CHold, I say, and I will give you
    the freedom of the\r\ngreenwood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, God-a-mercy,\u201D said
    Arthur; \u201CI may thank my staff for that--not\r\n_you_.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,
    well, gossip\u2019 let be as it may. But prithee tell me your name and\r\ntrade.
    I like to know fellows who can hit a blow like that same last.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am a tanner,\u201D replied Arthur-a-Bland. \u201CIn Nottingham long have\r\nI
    wrought. And if you\u2019ll come to me I swear I\u2019ll tan your hides for\r\nnaught.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COdds
    bodikins!\u201D quoth Robin ruefully. \u201CMine own hide is tanned enough\r\nfor
    the present. Howsoever, there be others in this wood I would fain\r\nsee you
    tackle. Harkee, if you will leave your tan-pots and come with\r\nme, as sure
    as my name is Robin Hood, you shan\u2019t want gold or fee.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    the breath o\u2019 my body!\u201D said Arthur, \u201Cthat will I do!\u201D and
    he\r\ngripped him gladly by the hand. \u201CBut I am minded that I clean forgot
    the\r\nerrand that brought me to Sherwood. I was commissioned by some, under\r\nthe
    Sheriff\u2019s roof, to capture you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo was a certain tinker,
    now in our service,\u201D said Robin smilingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CVerily \u2018tis
    a new way to recruit forces!\u201D said the tanner laughing\r\nloudly. \u201CBut
    tell me, good Robin Hood, where is Little John? I fain\r\nwould see him, for
    he is a kinsman on my mother\u2019s side.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHere am I, good
    Arthur-a-Bland!\u201D said a voice; and Little John\r\nliterally rolled out from
    under the bush to the sward. His eyes were\r\nfull of tears from much laughter
    which had well-nigh left him powerless\r\nto get on his feet.\r\n\r\nAs soon
    as the astonished tanner saw who it was, he gave Little John a\r\nmighty hug
    around the neck, and lifted him up on his feet, and the two\r\npounded each other
    on the back soundly, so glad were they to meet again.\r\n\r\n\u201CO, man, man!\u201D
    said Little John as soon as he had got his breath. \u201CNever\r\nsaw I so fine
    a sight in all my born days. You did knock him over like\r\nas he were a ninepin!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    you do joy to see me thwacked about on the ribs?\u201D asked Robin with\r\nsome
    choler.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, not that, master!\u201D said Little John. \u201CBut
    \u2018tis the second time I\r\nhave had special tickets to a show from beneath
    the bushes, and I cannot\r\nforbear my delight. Howsoever, take no shame unto
    yourself, for\r\nthis same Arthur-a-Bland is the best man at the quarter-staff
    in all\r\nNottinghamshire. It commonly takes two or three men to hold him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CUnless
    it be Eric o\u2019 Lincoln,\u201D said Arthur modestly; \u201Cand I well know\r\nhow
    you paid him out at the Fair.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSay no more!\u201D said Robin
    springing to his feet; \u201Cfor well I know that I\r\nhave done good business
    this day, and a few bruises are easy payment\r\nfor the stout cudgel I am getting
    into the band. Your hand again, good\r\nArthur-a-Bland! Come! let us after the
    deer of which I spoiled your\r\nstalking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRighty gladly!\u201D
    quoth Arthur. \u201CCome, Cousin Little John! Away with\r\nvats and tan-bark
    and vile-smelling cowhides! I\u2019ll follow you two in the\r\nsweet open air
    to the very ends of earth!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN
    HOOD MET SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA\r\n\r\n     Then answered him the gentle knight\r\n    
    With words both fair and thee:\r\n     \u201CGod save thee, my good Robin,\r\n    
    And all thy company!\u201D\r\n\r\nNow you must know that some months passed by.
    The winter dragged its\r\nweary length through Sherwood Forest, and Robin Hood
    and his merry men\r\nfound what cheer they could in the big crackling fires before
    their\r\nwoodland cave. Friar Tuck had built him a little hermitage not far away,\r\nwhere
    he lived comfortably with his numerous dogs.\r\n\r\nThe winter, I say, reached
    an end at last, and the blessed spring came\r\nand went. Another summer passed
    on apace, and still neither King nor\r\nSheriff nor Bishop could catch the outlaws,
    who, meanwhile, thrived and\r\nprospered mightily in their outlawry. The band
    had been increased\r\nfrom time to time by picked men such as Arthur-a-Bland
    and David of\r\nDoncaster--he who was the jolliest cobbler for miles around--until
    it\r\nnow numbered a full sevenscore of men; seven companies each with its\r\nstout
    lieutenant serving under Robin Hood. And still they relieved the\r\npurses of
    the rich, and aided the poor, and feasted upon King\u2019s deer\r\nuntil the
    lank Sheriff of Nottingham was well-nigh distracted.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that official
    would probable have lost his office entirely, had\r\nit not been for the fact
    of the King\u2019s death. Henry passed away, as all\r\nKings will, in common
    with ordinary men, and Richard of the Lion Heart\r\nwas proclaimed as his successor.\r\n\r\nThen
    Robin and his men, after earnest debate, resolved to throw\r\nthemselves upon
    the mercy of the new King, swear allegiance, and ask to\r\nbe organized into
    Royal Foresters. So Will Scarlet and Will Stutely and\r\nLittle John were sent
    to London with this message, which they were first\r\nto entrust privately to
    Maid Marian. But they soon returned with bad\r\ntidings. The new King had formerly
    set forth upon a crusade to the Holy\r\nLand, and Prince John, his brother, was
    impossible to deal with--being\r\ncrafty, cruel and treacherous. He was laying
    his hands upon all the\r\nproperty which could easily be seized; among other
    estates, that of\r\nthe Earl of Huntingdon, Robin\u2019s old enemy and Marian\u2019s
    father, who had\r\nlately died.\r\n\r\nMarian herself was in sore straits. Not
    only had her estates been taken\r\naway, and the maid been deprived of the former
    protection of the Queen,\r\nbut the evil Prince John had persecuted her with
    his attentions. He\r\nthought that since the maid was defenseless he could carry
    her away to\r\none of his castles and none could gainsay him.\r\n\r\nNo word
    of this peril reached Robin\u2019s ears, although his men brought\r\nhim word
    of the seizure of the Huntingdon lands. Nathless he was greatly\r\nalarmed for
    the safety of Maid Marian, and his heart cried out for\r\nher strongly. She had
    been continually in his thoughts ever since the\r\nmemorable shooting at London
    town.\r\n\r\nOne morning in early autumn when the leaves were beginning to turn
    gold\r\nat the edges, the chestnut-pods to swell with promise of fatness, and\r\nthe
    whole wide woodland was redolent with the ripe fragrance of fruit\r\nand flower,
    Robin was walking along the edge of a small open glade busy\r\nwith his thoughts.
    The peace of the woods was upon him, despite his\r\nbroodings of Marian and he
    paid little heed to a group of does quietly\r\nfeeding among the trees at the
    far edge of the glade.\r\n\r\nBut presently this sylvan picture was rudely disturbed
    for him. A stag,\r\nwild and furious, dashed suddenly forth from among the trees,
    scattering\r\nthe does in swift alarm. The vicious beast eyed the green-and-gold
    tunic\r\nof Robin, and, lowering it head, charged at him impetuously. So sudden\r\nwas
    its attack that Robin had no time to bend his bow. He sprang behind\r\na tree
    while he seized his weapon.\r\n\r\nA moment later the wild stag crashed blindly
    into the tree-trunk with a\r\nshock which sent the beast reeling backward, while
    the dislodged leaves\r\nfrom the shivering tree fell in a small shower over Robin\u2019s
    head.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy my halidom, I am glad it was not me you struck, my gentle
    friend!\u201D\r\n quoth Robin, fixing an arrow upon the string. \u201CSorry indeed
    would be any\r\none\u2019s plight who should encounter you in this black humor.\u201D\r\n\r\nScarcely
    had he spoken when he saw the stag veer about and fix its\r\nglances rigidly
    on the bushes to the left side of the glade. These were\r\nparted by a delicate
    hand, and through the opening appeared the slight\r\nfigure of a page. It was
    Maid Marian, come back again to the greenwood!\r\n\r\nShe advanced, unconscious
    alike of Robin\u2019s horrified gaze and the evil\r\nfury of the stag.\r\n\r\nShe
    was directly in line with the animal, so Robin dared not launch an\r\narrow.
    Her own bow was slung across her shoulder, and her small sword\r\nwould be useless
    against the beast\u2019s charge. But now as she caught sight\r\nof the stag she
    pursed her lips as though she would whistle to it.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor the love
    of God, dear lady!\u201D cried Robin; and then the words died\r\nin his throat.\r\n\r\nWith
    a savage snort of rage, the beast rushed at this new and inviting\r\ntarget--rushed
    so swiftly and from so short a distance that she could\r\nnot defend herself.
    She sprang to one side as it charged down upon her,\r\nbut a side blow from its
    antlers stretched her upon the ground. The stag\r\nstopped, turned, and lowered
    its head preparing to gore her to death.\r\n\r\nAlready its cruel horns were
    coming straight for her, while she, white\r\nof face and bewildered by the sudden
    attack, was struggling to rise\r\nand draw her sword. A moment more and the end
    would come. But the sharp\r\nvoice of Robin and already spoken.\r\n\r\n\u201CDown,
    Marian!\u201D he cried, and the girl instinctively obeyed, just as\r\nthe shaft
    from Robin\u2019s bow went whizzing close above her head and struck\r\nwith terrific
    force full in the center of the stag\u2019s forehead.\r\n\r\nThe beast stumbled
    in its charge and fell dead, across the body of the\r\nfainting maid.\r\n\r\nRobin
    was quickly by her side, and dragged the beast from off the girl.\r\n\r\nPicking
    her up in his strong arms, he bore her swiftly to the side of\r\none of the many
    brooks which watered the vale.\r\n\r\nHe dashed cool water upon her face, roughly
    almost, in his agony of fear\r\nthat the she was already dead, and he could have
    shed tears of joy to\r\nsee those poor, closed eyelids tremble. He redoubled
    his efforts; and\r\npresently she gave a little gasp.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere am I?
    What is\u2019t?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are in Sherwood, dear maid, tho\u2019,
    i\u2019 faith, we gave you a rude\r\nreception!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes
    and sat up. \u201CMethinks you have rescued me from\r\nsudden danger, sir,\u201D
    she said.\r\n\r\nThen she recognized Robin for the first time, and a radiant
    smile came\r\nover her face, together with the rare blush of returned vitality,\r\nand
    her head sank upon his shoulder with a little tremble and sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,
    Robin, it is you!\u201D she murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, \u2018tis I. Thank heaven,
    I was at hand to do you service!\u201D Robin\u2019s\r\ntones were deep and full
    of feeling. \u201CI swear, dear Marian, that I will\r\nnot let you from my care
    henceforth.\u201D\r\n\r\nNot another word was spoken for some moments, while
    her head still\r\nrested confidingly upon his breast. Then recollecting, he suddenly\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\u201CGramercy,
    I make but a poor nurse! I have not even asked if any of your\r\nbones were broken.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,
    not any,\u201D she answered springing lightly to her feet to show him.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    foolish dizziness o\u2019ercame me for the nonce, but we can now\r\nproceed on
    our way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, I meant not that,\u201D he protested; \u201Cwhy
    should we haste? First tell\r\nme of the news in London town, and of yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    she told him how that the Prince had seized upon her father\u2019s lands,\r\nand
    had promised to restore them to her if she would listen to his suit;\r\nand how
    that she knew he meant her no good, for he was even then suing\r\nfor a Princess\u2019s
    hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is all, Robin,\u201D she ended simply; \u201Cand that
    is why I donned again\r\nmy page\u2019s costume and came to you in the greenwood.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin\u2019s
    brow had grown fiercely black at the recital of her wrong; and\r\nhe had laid
    stern hand upon the hilt of his sword. \u201CBy this sword which\r\nQueen Eleanor
    gave me!\u201D he said impetuously; \u201Cand which was devoted to\r\nthe service
    of all womankind, I take oath that Prince John and all his\r\narmies shall not
    harm you!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo that is how Maid Marian came to take up her abode in
    the greenwood,\r\nwhere the whole band of yeomen welcomed her gladly and swore
    fealty; and\r\nwhere the sweet lady of Allan-a-Dale made her fully at home.\r\n\r\nBut
    this was a day of deeds in Sherwood Forest, and we \u2018gan to tell you\r\nanother
    happening which led to later events.\r\n\r\nWhile Robin and Marian were having
    their encounter with the stag, Little\r\nJohn, Much the miller\u2019s son, and
    Will Scarlet had sallied forth to watch\r\nthe highroad leading to Barnesdale,
    if perchance they might find some\r\nhaughty knight or fat priest whose wallet
    needed lightening.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely watched the great road known as Watling
    Street which\r\nruns from Dover in Kent to Chester town--for many minutes, when
    they\r\nespied a knight riding by in a very forlorn and careless manner.\r\n\r\n    
    All dreary was his semblance,\r\n     And little was his pride,\r\n     His one\r\n    
    foot in the stirrup stood,\r\n     His other waved beside.\r\n\r\n     His visor
    hung down o\u2019er his eyes,\r\n     He rode in single array,\r\n     A sorrier
    man than he was one\r\n     Rode never in summer\u2019s day.\r\n\r\nLittle John
    came up to the knight and bade him stay; for who can\r\njudge of a man\u2019s
    wealth by his looks? The outlaw bent his knee in all\r\ncourtesy, and prayed
    him to accept the hospitality of the forest.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy master expects you
    to dine with him, to-day,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand indeed\r\nhas been fasting
    while awaiting your coming, these three hours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is your
    master?\u201D asked the knight.\r\n\r\n\u201CNone other than Robin Hood,\u201D
    replied Little John, laying his hand upon\r\nthe knight\u2019s bridle.\r\n\r\nSeeing
    the other two outlaws approaching, the knight shrugged his\r\nshoulders, and
    replied indifferently.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis clear that your invitation is too
    urgent to admit of refusal,\u201D\r\n quoth he, \u201Cand I go with you right
    willingly, my friends. My purpose\r\nwas to have dined to-day at Blyth or Doncaster;
    but nothing matters\r\ngreatly.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo in the same lackadaisical fashion
    which had marked all his actions\r\nthat day, the knight suffered his horse to
    be led to the rendezvous of\r\nthe band in the greenwood.\r\n\r\nMarian had not
    yet had time to change her page\u2019s attire, when the three\r\nescorts of the
    knight hove in sight. She recognized their captive as Sir\r\nRichard of the Lea,
    whom she had often seen at court; and fearing lest\r\nhe might recognize her,
    she would have fled. But Robin asked her, with a\r\ntwinkle, if she would not
    like to play page that day, and she in roguish\r\nmood consented to do so.\r\n\r\n\u201CWelcome,
    Sir Knight,\u201D said Robin, courteously. \u201CYou are come in good\r\ntime,
    for we were just preparing to sit down to meat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod save and
    thank you, good master Robin,\u201D returned the knight; \u201Cand\r\nall your
    company. It likes me well to break the fast with you.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo while his
    horse was cared for, the knight laid aside his own heavy\r\ngear, and laved his
    face and hands, and sat down with Robin and all his\r\nmen to a most plentiful
    repast of venison, swans, pheasants, various\r\nsmall birds, cake and ale. And
    Marian stood behind Robin and filled his\r\ncup and that of the guest.\r\n\r\nAfter
    eating right heartily of the good cheer, the knight brightened\r\nup greatly
    and vowed that he had not enjoyed so good a dinner for nigh\r\nthree weeks. He
    also said that if ever Robin and his fellows should come\r\nto his domains, he
    would strive to set them down to as good a dinner on\r\nhis own behalf.\r\n\r\nBut
    this was not exactly the sort of payment which Robin had expected to\r\nreceive.
    He thanked the knight, therefore, in set phrase, but reminded\r\nhim that a yeoman
    like himself might hardly offer such a dinner to a\r\nknight as a gift of charity.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have no money, Master Robin,\u201D answered the knight frankly. \u201CI have
    so\r\nlittle of the world\u2019s goods, in sooth, that I should be ashamed to
    offer\r\nyou the whole of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMoney, however little, always
    jingles merrily in our pockets,\u201D said\r\nRobin, smiling. \u201CPray you
    tell me what you deem a little sum.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have of my own ten silver
    pennies,\u201D said the knight. \u201CHere they are,\r\nand I wish they were
    ten times as many.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe handed Little John his pouch, and Robin nodded
    carelessly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat say you to the total, Little John?\u201D he asked
    as though in jest.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis true enough, as the worthy knight hath
    said,\u201D responded the big\r\nfellow gravely emptying the contents on his
    cloak.\r\n\r\nRobin signed to Marian, who filled a bumper of wine for himself
    and his\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n\u201CPledge me, Sir Knight!\u201D cried the merry outlaw;
    \u201Cand pledge me\r\nheartily, for these sorry times. I see that your armor
    is bent and that\r\nyour clothes are torn. Yet methinks I saw you at court, once
    upon a day,\r\nand in more prosperous guise. Tell me now, were you a yeoman and
    made a\r\nknight by force? Or, have you been a bad steward to yourself, and wasted\r\nyour
    property in lawsuits and the like? Be not bashful with us. We shall\r\nnot betray
    your secrets.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am a Saxon knight in my own right; and I have
    always lived a sober\r\nand quiet life,\u201D the sorrowful guest replied. \u201C\u2018Tis
    true you have seen\r\nme at court, mayhap, for I was an excited witness of your
    shooting\r\nbefore King Harry--God rest his bones! My name is Sir Richard of
    the\r\nLea, and I dwell in a castle, not a league from one of the gates of\r\nNottingham,
    which has belonged to my father, and his father, and his\r\nfather\u2019s father
    before him. Within two or three years ago my neighbors\r\nmight have told you
    that a matter of four hundred pounds one way or\r\nthe other was as naught to
    me. But now I have only these ten pennies of\r\nsilver, and my wife and son.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn
    what manner have you lost your riches?\u201D asked Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CThrough
    folly and kindness,\u201D said the knight, sighing. \u201CI went with\r\nKing
    Richard upon a crusade, from which I am but lately returned, in\r\ntime to find
    my son--a goodly youth--grown up. He was but twenty, yet he\r\nhad achieved a
    squire\u2019s training and could play prettily in jousts and\r\ntournaments and
    other knightly games. But about this time he had the ill\r\nluck to push his
    sport too far, and did accidentally kill a knight in\r\nthe open lists. To save
    the boy, I had to sell my lands and mortgage my\r\nancestral castle; and this
    not being enough, in the end I have had to\r\nborrow money, at a ruinous interest,
    from my lord of Hereford.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA most worthy Bishop,\u201D said
    Robin ironically. \u201CWhat is the sum of your\r\ndebt?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFour
    hundred pounds,\u201D said Sir Richard, \u201Cand the Bishop swears he will\r\nforeclose
    the mortgage if they are not paid promptly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you any friends
    who would become surety for you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot one. If good King Richard
    were here, the tale might be otherwise.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFill your goblet again,
    Sir Knight,\u201D said Robin; and he turned to\r\nwhisper a word in Marian\u2019s
    ear. She nodded and drew Little John and Will\r\nScarlet aside and talked earnestly
    with them, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere is health and prosperity to you,
    gallant Robin,\u201D said Sir Richard,\r\ntilting his goblet. \u201CI hope I
    may pay your cheer more worthily, the next\r\ntime I ride by.\u201D\r\n\r\nWill
    Scarlet and Little John had meanwhile fallen in with Marian\u2019s idea,\r\nfor
    they consulted the other outlaws, who nodded their heads. Thereupon\r\nLittle
    John and Will Scarlet went into the cave near by and presently\r\nreturned bearing
    a bag of gold. This they counted out before the\r\nastonished knight; and there
    were four times one hundred gold pieces in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake this loan
    from us, Sir Knight, and pay your debt to the Bishop,\u201D\r\n then said Robin.
    \u201CNay, no thanks; you are but exchanging creditors.\r\nMayhap we shall not
    be so hard upon you as the Christian Bishop; yet,\r\nagain we may be harder.
    Who can tell?\u201D\r\n\r\nThere were actual tears in Sir Richard\u2019s eyes,
    as he essayed to thank\r\nthe foresters. But at this juncture, Much, the miller\u2019s
    son, came from\r\nthe cave dragging a bale of cloth. \u201CThe knight should
    have a suit worthy\r\nof his rank, master--think you not so?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMeasure
    him twenty ells of it,\u201D ordered Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive him a good horse,
    also,\u201D whispered Marian. \u201C\u2018Tis a gift which will\r\ncome back
    four-fold, for this is a worthy man. I know him well.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the horse
    was given, also, and Robin bade Arthur-a-Bland ride with\r\nthe knight as far
    as his castle, as esquire.\r\n\r\nThe knight was sorrowful no longer; yet he
    could hardly voice his thanks\r\nthrough his broken utterance. And having spent
    the night in rest,\r\nafter listening to Allan-a-Dale\u2019s singing, he mounted
    his new steed the\r\nfollowing morning an altogether different man.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    save you, comrades, and keep you all!\u201D said he, with deep feeling\r\nin
    his tones; \u201Cand give me a grateful heart!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe shall wait
    for you twelve months from to-day, here in this place,\u201D\r\n said Robin,
    shaking him by the hand; \u201Cand then you will repay us the\r\nloan, if you
    have been prospered.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall return it to you within the year,
    upon my honor as Sir Richard\r\nof the Lea. And for all time, pray count on me
    as a steadfast friend.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying the knight and his esquire rode
    down the forest glade till\r\nthey were lost to view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XVII\r\n\r\nHOW THE BISHOP WAS DINED\r\n\r\n     \u201CO what is the matter?\u201D
    then said the Bishop,\r\n     \u201COr for whom do you make this a-do?\r\n    
    Or why do you kill the King\u2019s venison,\r\n     When your company is so few?\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CWe are shepherds,\u201D quoth bold Robin Hood,\r\n     \u201CAnd we keep
    sheep all the year,\r\n     And we are disposed to be merrie this day,\r\n    
    And to kill of the King\u2019s fat deer.\u201D\r\n\r\nNot many days after Sir
    Richard of the Lea came to Sherwood Forest,\r\nword reached Robin Hood\u2019s
    ears that my lord Bishop of Hereford would\r\nbe riding that way betimes on that
    morning. \u2018Twas Arthur-a-Bland, the\r\nknight\u2019s quondam esquire, who
    brought the tidings, and Robin\u2019s face\r\nbrightened as he heard it.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,
    by our Lady!\u201D quoth he, \u201CI have long desired to entertain my lord\r\nin
    the greenwood, and this is too fair a chance to let slip. Come, my\r\nmen, kill
    me a venison; kill me a good fat deer. The Bishop of Hereford\r\nis to dine with
    me today, and he shall pay well for his cheer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShall we dress
    it here, as usual?\u201D asked Much, the miller\u2019s son.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    we play a droll game on the churchman. We will dress it by the\r\nhighway side,
    and watch for the Bishop narrowly, lest he should ride\r\nsome other way.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    Robin gave his orders, and the main body of his men dispersed to\r\ndifferent
    parts of the forest, under Will Stutely and Little John,\r\nto watch other roads;
    while Robin Hood himself took six of his men,\r\nincluding Will Scarlet, and
    Much, and posted himself in full view of the\r\nmain road. This little company
    appeared funny enough, I assure you, for\r\nthey had disguised themselves as
    shepherds. Robin had an old wool cap,\r\nwith a tail to it, hanging over his
    ear, and a shock of hair stood\r\nstraight up through a hole in the top. Besides
    there was so much dirt on\r\nhis face that you would never have known him. An
    old tattered cloak over\r\nhis hunter\u2019s garb completed his make-up. The
    others were no less ragged\r\nand unkempt, even the foppish Will Scarlet being
    so badly run down at\r\nthe heel that the court ladies would hardly have had
    speech with him.\r\n\r\nThey quickly provided themselves with a deer and made
    great preparations\r\nto cook it over a small fire, when a little dust was seen
    blowing along\r\nthe highway, and out of it came the portly Bishop cantering
    along with\r\nten men-at-arms at his heels. As soon as he saw the fancied shepherds
    he\r\nspurred up his horse, and came straight toward them.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are
    ye, fellows, who make so free with the King\u2019s deer?\u201D he asked\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    are shepherds,\u201D answered Robin Hood, pulling at his forelock\r\nawkwardly.\r\n\r\n\u201CHeaven
    have mercy! Ye seem a sorry lot of shepherds. But who gave you\r\nleave to cease
    eating mutton?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis one of our feast days, lording, and
    we were disposed to be merry\r\nthis day, and make free with a deer, out here
    where they are so many.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy me faith, the King shall hear of
    this. Who killed yon beast?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me first your name, excellence,
    so that I may speak where \u2018tis\r\nfitting,\u201D replied Robin stubbornly.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis
    my lord Bishop of Hereford, fellow!\u201D interposed one of the guards\r\nfiercely.
    \u201CSee that you keep a civil tongue in your head.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf \u2018tis
    a churchman,\u201D retorted Will Scarlet, \u201Che would do better to\r\nmind
    his own flocks rather than concern himself with ours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYe are
    saucy fellows, in sooth,\u201D cried the Bishop, \u201Cand we will see if\r\nyour
    heads will pay for your manners. Come! quit your stolen roast and\r\nmarch along
    with me, for you shall be brought before the Sheriff of\r\nNottingham forthwith.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPardon,
    excellence!\u201D said Robin, dropping on his knees. \u201CPardon, I pray\r\nyou.
    It becomes not your lordship\u2019s coat to take so many lives away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith,
    I\u2019ll pardon you!\u201D said the Bishop. \u201CI\u2019ll pardon you, when
    I see\r\nyou hanged! Seize upon them, my men!\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Robin had already
    sprung away with his back against a tree. And\r\nfrom underneath his ragged cloak
    he drew his trusty horn and winded the\r\npiercing notes which were wont to summon
    the band.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop no sooner saw this action than he knew his man, and
    that\r\nthere was a trap set; and being an arrant coward, he wheeled his horse\r\nsharply
    and would have made off down the road; but his own men, spurred\r\non the charge,
    blocked his way. At almost the same instant the bushes\r\nround about seemed
    literally to become alive with outlaws. Little John\u2019s\r\nmen came from one
    side and Will Stutely\u2019s from the other. In less time\r\nthan it takes to
    tell it, the worthy Bishop found himself a prisoner,\r\nand began to crave mercy
    from the men he had so lately been ready to\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n     \u201CO
    pardon, O pardon,\u201D said the Bishop,\r\n     \u201CO pardon, I you pray.\r\n    
    For if I had known it had been you,\r\n     I\u2019d have gone some other way.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    owe you no pardon,\u201D retorted Robin, \u201Cbut I will e\u2019en treat you
    better\r\nthan you would have treated me. Come, make haste, and go along with
    me.\r\nI have already planned that you shall dine with me this day.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    the unwilling prelate was dragged away, cheek by jowl, with the\r\nhalf-cooked
    venison upon the back of his own horse; and Robin and his\r\nband took charge
    of the whole company and led them through the forest\r\nglades till they came
    to an open space near Barnesdale.\r\n\r\nHere they rested, and Robin gave the
    Bishop a seat full courteously.\r\nMuch the miller\u2019s son fell to roasting
    the deer afresh, while another\r\nand fatter beast was set to frizzle on the
    other side of the fire.\r\nPresently the appetizing odor of the cooking reached
    the Bishop\u2019s\r\nnostrils, and he sniffed it eagerly. The morning\u2019s
    ride had made him\r\nhungry; and he was nothing loath when they bade him come
    to the dinner.\r\nRobin gave him the best place beside himself, and the Bishop
    prepared to\r\nfall to.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, my lord, craving your pardon, but we
    are accustomed to have grace\r\nbefore meat,\u201D said Robin decorously. \u201CAnd
    as our own chaplain is not\r\nwith us to-day, will you be good enough to say
    it for us?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Bishop reddened, but pronounced grace in the Latin
    tongue hastily,\r\nand then settled himself to make the best of his lot. Red
    wines and ale\r\nwere brought forth and poured out, each man having a horn tankard
    from\r\nwhich to drink.\r\n\r\nLaughter bubbled among the diners, and the Bishop
    caught himself smiling\r\nat more than one jest. But who, in sooth, could resist
    a freshly broiled\r\nvenison streak eaten out in the open air to the tune of
    jest and good\r\nfellowship? Stutely filled the Bishop\u2019s beaker with wine
    each time he\r\nemptied it, and the Bishop got mellower and mellower as the afternoon\r\nshades
    lengthened on toward sunset. Then the approaching dusk warned him\r\nof his position.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    wish, mine host,\u201D quoth he gravely to Robin, who had soberly drunk\r\nbut
    one cup of ale, \u201Cthat you would now call a reckoning. \u2018Tis late, and\r\nI
    fear the cost of this entertainment may be more than my poor purse can\r\nstand.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor
    he bethought himself of his friend, the Sheriff\u2019s former experience.\r\n\r\n\u201CVerily,
    your lordship,\u201D said Robin, scratching his head, \u201CI have\r\nenjoyed
    your company so much, that I scarce know how to charge for it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLend
    me your purse, my lord,\u201D said Little John, interposing, \u201Cand\r\nI\u2019ll
    give you the reckoning by and by.\u201D The Bishop shuddered. He had\r\ncollected
    Sir Richard\u2019s debt only that morning, and was even then\r\ncarrying it home.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have but a few silver pennies of my own,\u201D he whined; \u201Cand as for the\r\ngold
    in my saddle-bags, \u2018tis for the church. Ye surely would not levy\r\nupon
    the church, good friends.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Little John was already gone to the
    saddle-bags, and returning\r\nhe laid the Bishop\u2019s cloak upon the ground,
    and poured out of the\r\nportmantua a matter of four hundred glittering gold
    pieces. \u2018Twas the\r\nidentical money which Robin had lent Sir Richard a
    short while before!\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D said Robin, as though an idea had
    but just then come to him. \u201CThe\r\nchurch is always willing to aid in charity.
    And seeing this goodly sum\r\nreminds me that I have a friend who is indebted
    to a churchman for this\r\nexact amount. Now we shall charge you nothing on our
    own account; but\r\nsuffer us to make use of this in aiding my good friend.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    nay,\u201D began the Bishop with a wry face, \u201Cthis is requiting me ill\r\nindeed.
    Was this not the King\u2019s meat, after all, that we feasted upon?\r\nFurthermore,
    I am a poor man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor forsooth!\u201D answered Robin in scorn.
    \u201CYou are the Bishop of\r\nHereford, and does not the whole countryside speak
    of your oppression?\r\nWho does not know of your cruelty to the poor and ignorant--you
    who\r\nshould use your great office to aid them, instead of oppress? Have you\r\nnot
    been guilty of far greater robbery than this, even though less\r\nopen? Of myself,
    and how you have pursued me, I say nothing; nor of\r\nyour unjust enmity against
    my father. But on account of those you have\r\ndespoiled and oppressed, I take
    this money, and will use it far more\r\nworthily than you would. God be my witness
    in this! There is an end of\r\nthe matter, unless you will lead us in a song
    or dance to show that\r\nyour body had a better spirit than your mind. Come,
    strike up the harp,\r\nAllan!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNeither the one nor the other
    will I do,\u201D snarled the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith, then we must help you,\u201D
    said Little John; and he and\r\nArthur-a-Bland seized the fat struggling churchman
    and commenced to hop\r\nup and down. The Bishop being shorter must perforce accompany
    them in\r\ntheir gyrations; while the whole company sat and rolled about over
    the\r\nground, and roared to see my lord of Hereford\u2019s queer capers. At
    last he\r\nsank in a heap, fuddled with wine and quite exhausted.\r\n\r\nLittle
    John picked him up as though he were a log of wood and carrying\r\nhim to his
    horse, set him astride facing the animal\u2019s tail; and thus\r\nfastened him,
    leading the animal toward the highroad and, starting the\r\nBishop, more dead
    than alive, toward Nottingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE
    BISHOP WENT OUTLAW-HUNTING\r\n\r\n     The Bishop he came to the old woman\u2019s
    house,\r\n     And called with furious mood,\r\n     \u201CCome let me soon see,
    and bring unto me\r\n     That traitor, Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe easy success
    with which they had got the better of the good Bishop\r\nled Robin to be a little
    careless. He thought that his guest was too\r\ngreat a coward to venture back
    into the greenwood for many a long day;\r\nand so after lying quiet for one day,
    the outlaw ventured boldly upon\r\nthe highway, the morning of the second. But
    he had gone only half a mile\r\nwhen, turning a sharp bend in the road, he plunged
    full upon the prelate\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMy lord of Hereford had been so deeply
    smitten in his pride, that he\r\nhad lost no time in summoning a considerable
    body of the Sheriff\u2019s men,\r\noffering to double the reward if Robin Hood
    could be come upon. This\r\ncompany was now at his heels, and after the first
    shock of mutual\r\nsurprise, the Bishop gave an exultant shout and spurred upon
    the outlaw.\r\n\r\nIt was too late for Robin to retreat by the way he had come,
    but quick\r\nas a flash he sprang to one side of the road, dodged under some
    bushes,\r\nand disappeared so suddenly that his pursuers thought he had truly
    been\r\nswallowed up by magic.\r\n\r\n\u201CAfter him!\u201D yelled the Bishop;
    \u201Csome of you beat up the woods around\r\nhim, while the rest of us will
    keep on the main road and head him off on\r\nthe other side!\u201D\r\n\r\nFor,
    truth to tell, the Bishop did not care to trust his bones away from\r\nthe highroad.\r\n\r\nAbout
    a mile away, on the other side of this neck of woods, wherein\r\nRobin had been
    trapped, was a little tumbledown cottage. \u2018Twas where\r\nthe widow lived,
    whose three sons had been rescued. Robin remembered the\r\ncottage and saw his
    one chance to escape.\r\n\r\nDoubling in and out among the underbrush and heather
    with the agility\r\nof a hare, he soon came out of the wood in the rear of the
    cottage, and\r\nthrust his head through a tiny window.\r\n\r\nThe widow, who
    had been at her spinning wheel, rose up with a cry of\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\u201CQuiet,
    good mother! \u2018Tis I, Robin Hood. Where are your three sons?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    should be with you, Robin. Well do you know that. Do they not owe\r\ntheir lives
    to you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf that be so, I come to seek payment of the debt,\u201D
    said Robin in a\r\nbreath. \u201CThe Bishop is on my heels with many of his men.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll
    cheat the Bishop and all!\u201D cried the woman quickly. \u201CHere, Robin,\r\nchange
    your raiment with me, and we will see if my lord knows an old\r\nwoman when he
    sees her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood!\u201D said Robin. \u201CPass your gray cloak
    out the window, and also your\r\nspindle and twine; and I will give you my green
    mantle and everything\r\nelse down to my bow and arrows.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile they
    were talking, Robin had been nimbly changing clothes with the\r\nold woman, through
    the window, and in a jiffy he stood forth complete,\r\neven to the spindle and
    twine.\r\n\r\nPresently up dashed the Bishop and his men, and, at sight of the\r\ncottage
    and the old woman, gave pause. The crone was hobbling along with\r\ndifficulty,
    leaning heavily upon a gnarled stick and bearing the spindle\r\non her other
    arm. She would have gone by the Bishop\u2019s company, while\r\nmuttering to
    herself, but the Bishop ordered one of his men to question\r\nher. The soldier
    laid his hand upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201CMind your business!\u201D croaked
    the woman, \u201Cor I\u2019ll curse ye!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, come, my good
    woman,\u201D said the soldier, who really was afraid of\r\nher curses. \u201CI\u2019ll
    not molest you. But my lord Bishop of Hereford wants\r\nto know if you have seen
    aught of the outlaw, Robin Hood?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd why shouldn\u2019t I
    see him?\u201D she whined. \u201CWhere\u2019s the King or law to\r\nprevent good
    Robin from coming to see me and bring me food and raiment?\r\nThat\u2019s more
    than my lord Bishop will do, I warrant ye!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeace, woman!\u201D
    said the Bishop harshly. \u201CWe want none of your opinions.\r\nBut we\u2019ll
    take you to Barnesdale and burn you for a witch if you do not\r\ninstantly tell
    us when you last saw Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMercy, good my lord!\u201D
    chattered the crone, falling on her knees.\r\n\r\n\u201CRobin is there in my
    cottage now, but you\u2019ll never take him alive.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll
    see about that,\u201D cried the Bishop triumphantly. \u201CEnter the\r\ncottage,
    my men. Fire it, if need be. But I\u2019ll give a purse of gold\r\npieces, above
    the reward, to the man who captures the outlaw alive.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old woman,
    being released, went on her way slowly. But it might\r\nhave been noticed that
    the farther she got away from the company and\r\nthe nearer to the edge of the
    woods, the swifter and straighter grew\r\nher pace. Once inside the shelter of
    the forest she broke into a run of\r\nsurprising swiftness.\r\n\r\n\u201CGadzooks!\u201D
    exclaimed Little John who presently spied her. \u201CWho comes\r\nhere? Never
    saw I witch or woman run so fast. Methinks I\u2019ll send an\r\narrow close over
    her head to see which it is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CO hold your hand! hold your hand!\u201D
    panted the supposed woman. \u201C\u2018Tis I,\r\nRobin Hood. Summon the yeomen
    and return with me speedily. We have still\r\nanother score to settle with my
    lord of Hereford.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Little John could catch his breath from laughing,
    he winded his\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, mistress Robin,\u201D quoth he, grinning.
    \u201CLead on! We\u2019ll be close to\r\nyour heels.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    back at the widow\u2019s cottage the Bishop was growing more\r\nfurious every
    moment. For all his bold words, he dared not fire the\r\nhouse, and the sturdy
    door had thus far resisted all his men\u2019s efforts.\r\n\r\n\u201CBreak it
    down! Break it down!\u201D he shouted, \u201Cand let me soon see who\r\nwill
    fetch out that traitor, Robin Hood!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt last the door crashed in
    and the men stood guard on the threshold.\r\nBut not one dared enter for fear
    a sharp arrow should meet him halfway.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere he is!\u201D cried one
    keen-eyed fellow, peering in. \u201CI see him in the\r\ncorner by the cupboard.
    Shall we slay him with our pikes?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D said the Bishop,
    \u201Ctake him alive if you can. We\u2019ll make the\r\nbiggest public hanging
    of this that the shire ever beheld.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut the joy of the Bishop over
    his capture was short lived. Down the\r\nroad came striding the shabby figure
    of the old woman who had helped him\r\nset the trap; and very wrathy was she
    when she saw that the cottage door\r\nhad been battered in.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand
    by, you lazy rascals!\u201D she called to the soldiers. \u201CMay all the\r\ndevils
    catch ye for hurting an old woman\u2019s hut. Stand by, I say!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHold
    your tongue!\u201D ordered the Bishop. \u201CThese are my men and carrying\r\nout
    my orders.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod-mercy!\u201D swore the beldame harshly. \u201CThings
    have come to a pretty\r\npass when our homes may be treated like common gaols.
    Couldn\u2019t all your\r\nmen catch one poor forester without this ado? Come!
    clear out, you and\r\nyour robber, on the instant, or I\u2019ll curse every mother\u2019s
    son of ye,\r\neating and drinking and sleeping!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSeize on the
    hag!\u201D shouted the Bishop, as soon as he could get in a\r\nword. \u201CWe\u2019ll
    see about a witch\u2019s cursing. Back to town she shall go,\r\nalongside of
    Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot so fast, your worship!\u201D she retorted,
    clapping her hands.\r\n\r\nAnd at the signal a goodly array of greenwood men
    sprang forth from all\r\nsides of the cottage, with bows drawn back threateningly.
    The Bishop saw\r\nthat his men were trapped again, for they dared not stir. Nathless,
    he\r\ndetermined to make a fight for it.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf one of you but budge
    an inch toward me, you rascals,\u201D he cried, \u201Cit\r\nshall sound the death
    of your master, Robin Hood! My men have him here\r\nunder their pikes, and I
    shall command them to kill him without mercy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith, I should
    like to see the Robin you have caught,\u201D said a clear\r\nvoice from under
    the widow\u2019s cape; and the outlaw chief stood forth with\r\nbared head, smilingly.
    \u201CHere am I, my lord, in no wise imperiled by your\r\nmen\u2019s fierce pikes.
    So let us see whom you have been guarding so well.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old woman
    who, in the garb of Robin Hood, had been lying quiet in\r\nthe cottage through
    all the uproar, jumped up nimbly at this. In the\r\nbald absurdity of her disguise
    she came to the doorway and bowed to the\r\nBishop.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive you good-den,
    my lord Bishop,\u201D she piped in a shrill voice; \u201Cand\r\nwhat does your
    Grace at my humble door? Do you come to bless me and give\r\nme alms?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,
    that does he,\u201D answered Robin. \u201CWe shall see if his saddle-bags\r\ncontain
    enough to pay you for that battered door.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by all the saints--\u201D
    began the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake care; they are all watching you,\u201D interrupted
    Robin; \u201Cso name them\r\nnot upon your unchurchly lips. But I will trouble
    you to hand over that\r\npurse of gold you had saved to pay for my head.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll
    see you hanged first!\u201D raged the Bishop, stating no more than\r\nwhat would
    have been so, if he could do the ordering of things. \u201CHave at\r\nthem, my
    men, and hew them down in their tracks!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHold!\u201D retorted
    Robin. \u201CSee how we have you at our mercy.\u201D And aiming a\r\nsudden shaft
    he shot so close to the Bishop\u2019s head that it carried away\r\nboth his hat
    and the skull-cap which he always wore, leaving him quite\r\nbald.\r\n\r\nThe
    prelate turned as white as his shiny head and clutched wildly at his\r\nears.
    He thought himself dead almost.\r\n\r\n\u201CHelp! Murder!\u201D he gasped. \u201CDo
    not shoot again! Here\u2019s your purse of\r\ngold!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd without
    waiting for further parley he fairly bolted down the road.\r\n\r\nHis men being
    left leaderless had nothing for it but to retreat after\r\nhim, which they did
    in sullen order, covered by the bows of the yeomen.\r\nAnd thus ended the Bishop
    of Hereford\u2019s great outlaw-hunt in the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XIX\r\n\r\nHOW THE SHERIFF HELD ANOTHER SHOOTING MATCH\r\n\r\n     \u201CTo tell
    the truth, I\u2019m well informed\r\n     Yon match it is a wile;\r\n     The
    Sheriff, I know, devises this\r\n     Us archers to beguile.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow
    the Sheriff was so greatly troubled in heart over the growing power\r\nof Robin
    Hood, that he did a very foolish thing. He went to London town\r\nto lay his
    troubles before the King and get another force of troops to\r\ncope with the
    outlaws. King Richard was not yet returned from the Holy\r\nLand, but Prince
    John heard him with scorn.\r\n\r\n\u201CPooh!\u201D said he, shrugging his shoulders.
    \u201CWhat have I to do with all\r\nthis? Art thou not sheriff for me? The law
    is in force to take thy\r\ncourse of them that injure thee. Go, get thee gone,
    and by thyself\r\ndevise some tricking game to trap these rebels; and never let
    me see thy\r\nface at court again until thou hast a better tale to tell.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    away went the Sheriff in sorrier pass than ever, and cudgeled his\r\nbrain, on
    the way home, for some plan of action.\r\n\r\nHis daughter met him on his return
    and saw at once that he had been on a\r\npoor mission. She was minded to upbraid
    him when she learned what he\r\nhad told the Prince. But the words of the latter
    started her to thinking\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have it!\u201D she exclaimed
    at length. \u201CWhy should we not hold another\r\nshooting-match? \u2018Tis
    Fair year, as you know, and another tourney will\r\nbe expected. Now we will
    proclaim a general amnesty, as did King Harry\r\nhimself, and say that the field
    is open and unmolested to all comers.\r\nBelike Robin Hood\u2019s men will be
    tempted to twang the bow, and then--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd then,\u201D said
    the Sheriff jumping up with alacrity, \u201Cwe shall see on\r\nwhich side of
    the gate they stop over-night!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the Sheriff lost no time in proclaiming
    a tourney, to be held that\r\nsame Fall at the Fair. It was open to all comers,
    said the proclamation,\r\nand none should be molested in their going and coming.
    Furthermore, an\r\narrow with a golden head and shaft of silver-white should
    be given to\r\nthe winner, who would be heralded abroad as the finest archer
    in all the\r\nNorth Countree. Also, many rich prizes were to be given to other
    clever\r\narchers.\r\n\r\nThese tidings came in due course to Robin Hood, under
    the greenwood\r\ntree, and fired his impetuous spirit.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, prepare
    ye, my merry men all,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand we\u2019ll go to the\r\nFair
    and take some part in this sport.\u201D\r\n\r\nWith that stepped forth the merry
    cobbler, David of Doncaster.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaster,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cbe ruled
    by me and stir not from the greenwood. To\r\ntell the truth, I\u2019m well informed
    yon match is naught but a trap. I know\r\nthe Sheriff has devised it to beguile
    us archers into some treachery.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat word savors of the coward,\u201D
    replied Robin, \u201Cand pleases me not.\r\nLet come what will, I\u2019ll try
    my skill at that same archery.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen up spoke Little John and said:
    \u201CCome, listen to me how it shall be\r\nthat we will not be discovered.\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    \u201COur mantles all of Lincoln-green\r\n     Behind us we will leave;\r\n    
    We\u2019ll dress us all so several,\r\n     They shall not us perceive.\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    \u201COne shall wear white, another red,\r\n     One yellow, another blue;\r\n    
    Thus in disguise to the exercise\r\n     We\u2019ll go, whate\u2019er ensue.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis
    advice met with general favor from the adventurous fellows, and\r\nthey lost
    no time in putting it into practice. Maid Marian and Mistress\r\nDale, assisted
    by Friar Tuck, prepared some vari-colored costumes, and\r\n\u2018gainst the Fair
    day had fitted out the sevenscore men till you would\r\nnever have taken them
    for other than villagers decked for the holiday.\r\n\r\nAnd forth went they from
    the greenwood, with hearts all firm and stout,\r\nresolved to meet the Sheriff\u2019s
    men and have a merry bout. Along the\r\nhighway they fell in with many other
    bold fellows from the countryside,\r\ngoing with their ruddy-cheeked lasses toward
    the wide-open gates of\r\nNottingham.\r\n\r\nSo in through the gates trooped
    the whole gay company, Robin\u2019s men\r\nbehaving as awkwardly and laughing
    and talking as noisily as the rest;\r\nwhile the Sheriff\u2019s scowling men-at-arms
    stood round about and sought to\r\nfind one who looked like a forester, but without
    avail.\r\n\r\nThe herald now set forth the terms of the contest, as on former\r\noccasions,
    and the shooting presently began. Robin had chosen five of\r\nhis men to shoot
    with him, and the rest were to mingle with the crowd\r\nand also watch the gates.
    These five were Little John, Will Scarlet,\r\nWill Stutely, Much, and Allan-a-Dale\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe
    other competitors made a brave showing on the first round,\r\nespecially Gilbert
    of the White Hand, who was present and never shot\r\nbetter. The contest later
    narrowed down between Gilbert and Robin. But\r\nat the first lead, when the butts
    were struck so truly by various well\r\nknown archers, the Sheriff was in doubt
    whether to feel glad or sorry.\r\nHe was glad to see such skill, but sorry that
    the outlaws were not in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n     Some said, \u201CIf Robin Hood were
    here,\r\n     And all his men to boot,\r\n     Sure none of them could pass these
    men,\r\n     So bravely do they shoot.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye,\u201D quoth the
    Sheriff, and scratched his head,\r\n\r\n     \u201CI thought he would be here;\r\n    
    I thought he would, but tho\u2019 he\u2019s bold,\r\n     He durst not now appear.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis
    word was privately brought to Robin by David of Doncaster, and the\r\nsaying
    vexed him sorely. But he bit his lip in silence.\r\n\r\n\u201CEre long,\u201D
    he thought to himself, \u201Cwe shall see whether Robin Hood be\r\nhere or not!\u201D\r\n\r\nMeantime
    the shooting had been going forward, and Robin\u2019s men had done\r\nso well
    that the air was filled with shouts.\r\n\r\n     One cried, \u201CBlue jacket!\u201D
    another cried, \u201CBrown!\u201D\r\n      And a third cried, \u201CBrave Yellow!\u201D\r\n     
    But the fourth man said, \u201CYon man in red\r\n     In this place has no fellow.\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    For that was Robin Hood himself,\r\n     For he was clothed in red,\r\n     At
    every shot the prize he got,\r\n     For he was both sure and dead.\r\n\r\nThus
    went the second round of the shooting, and thus the third and last,\r\ntill even
    Gilbert of the White Hand was fairly beaten. During all this\r\nshooting, Robin
    exchanged no word with his men, each treating the other\r\nas a perfect stranger.
    Nathless, such great shooting could not pass\r\nwithout revealing the archers.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff thought he discovered, in the winner of the golden arrow,\r\nthe person
    of Robin Hood without peradventure. So he sent word privately\r\nfor his men-at-arms
    to close round the group. But Robin\u2019s men also got\r\nwind of the plan.\r\n\r\nTo
    keep up appearances, the Sheriff summoned the crowd to form in a\r\ncircle; and
    after as much delay as possible the arrow was presented. The\r\ndelay gave time
    enough for the soldiers to close in. As Robin received\r\nhis prize, bowed awkwardly,
    and turned away, the Sheriff, letting his\r\nzeal get the better of his discretion,
    grasped him about the neck and\r\ncalled upon his men to arrest the traitor.\r\n\r\nBut
    the moment the Sheriff touched Robin, he received such a buffet\r\non the side
    of his head that he let go instantly and fell back several\r\npaces. Turning
    to see who had struck him, he recognized Little John.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, rascal
    Greenleaf, I have you now!\u201D he exclaimed springing at him.\r\nJust then,
    however, he met a new check.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is from another of your devoted
    servants!\u201D said a voice which he\r\nknew to be that of Much the miller\u2019s
    son; and \u201CThwack!\u201D went his open\r\npalm upon the Sheriff\u2019s cheek
    sending that worthy rolling over and over\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\nBy this
    time the conflict had become general, but the Sheriff\u2019s men\r\nsuffered
    the disadvantage of being hampered by the crowd of innocent\r\non-lookers, whom
    they could not tell from the outlaws and so dared not\r\nattack; while the other
    outlaws in the rear fell upon them and put them\r\nin confusion.\r\n\r\nFor a
    moment a fierce rain of blows ensued; then the clear bugle-note\r\nfrom Robin
    ordered a retreat. The two warders at the nearest gate tried\r\nto close it,
    but were shot dead in their tracks. David of Doncaster\r\nthrew a third soldier
    into the moat; and out through the gate went\r\nthe foresters in good order,
    keeping a respectful distance between\r\nthemselves and the advancing soldiery,
    by means of their well-directed\r\nshafts.\r\n\r\nBut the fight was not to go
    easily this day, for the soldiery, smarting\r\nfrom their recent discomfiture
    at the widow\u2019s cottage, and knowing that\r\nthe eyes of the whole shire
    were upon them, fought well, and pressed\r\nclosely after the retreating outlaws.
    More than one ugly wound was\r\ngiven and received. No less than five of the
    Sheriff\u2019s men were killed\r\noutright, and a dozen others injured; while
    four of Robin\u2019s men were\r\nbleeding from severe flesh cuts.\r\n\r\nThen
    Little John, who had fought by the side of his chief, suddenly fell\r\nforward
    with a slight moan. An arrow had pierced his knee. Robin seized\r\nthe big fellow
    with almost superhuman strength.\r\n\r\n     Up he took him on his back,\r\n    
    And bare him well a mile;\r\n     Many a time he laid him down,\r\n     And shot
    another while.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Little John grew weaker and closed his eyes;
    at last he sank\r\nto the ground, and feebly motioned Robin to let him lie. \u201CMaster\r\nRobin,\u201D
    said he, \u201Chave I not served you well, ever since we met upon the\r\nbridge?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTruer
    servant never man had,\u201D answered Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen if ever you loved
    me, and for the sake of that service, draw your\r\nbright brown sword and strike
    off my head; never let me fall alive into\r\nthe hand of the Sheriff of Nottingham.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot
    for all the gold in England would I do either of the things you\r\nsuggest.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    forbid!\u201D cried Arthur-a-Bland, hurrying to the rescue. And packing\r\nhis
    wounded kinsman upon his own broad shoulders, he soon brought him\r\nwithin the
    shelter of the forest.\r\n\r\nOnce there, the Sheriff\u2019s men did not follow;
    and Robin caused litters\r\nof boughs to be made for Little John and the other
    four wounded men.\r\nQuickly were they carried through the wood until the hermitage
    of Friar\r\nTuck was reached, where their wounds were dressed. Little John\u2019s
    hurt\r\nwas pronounced to be the most serious of any, but he was assured that\r\nin
    two or three weeks\u2019 time he could get about again; whereat the active\r\ngiant
    groaned mightily.\r\n\r\nThat evening consternation came upon the hearts of the
    band. A careful\r\nroll-call was taken to see it all the yeomen had escaped,
    when it was\r\nfound that Will Stutely was missing, and Maid Marian also was
    nowhere to\r\nbe found. Robin was seized with dread. He knew that Marian had
    gone to\r\nthe Fair, but felt that she would hardly come to grief. Her absence,\r\nhowever,
    portended some danger, and he feared that it was connected with\r\nWill Stutely.
    The Sheriff would hang him speedily and without mercy, if\r\nhe were captured.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the band shared their leader\u2019s uneasiness, though they said\r\nno
    word. They knew that if Will were captured, the battle must be fought\r\nover
    again the next day, and Will must be saved at any cost. But no man\r\nflinched
    from the prospect.\r\n\r\nThat evening, while the Sheriff and his wife and daughter
    sat at meat in\r\nthe Mansion House, the Sheriff boasted of how he would make
    an example\r\nof the captured outlaw; for Stutely had indeed fallen into his
    hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe shall be strung high,\u201D he said, in a loud voice;
    \u201Cand none shall\r\ndare lift a finger. I now have Robin Hood\u2019s men
    on the run, and we shall\r\nsoon see who is master in this shire. I am only sorry
    that we let them\r\nhave the golden arrow.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a missive
    sped through a window and fell clattering upon his\r\nplate, causing him to spring
    back in alarm.\r\n\r\nIt was the golden arrow, and on its feathered shaft was
    sewed a little\r\nnote which read:\r\n\r\n\u201CThis from one who will take no
    gifts from liars; and who henceforth\r\nwill show no mercy. Look well to yourself.
    R.H.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nHOW WILL STUTELY WAS RESCUED\r\n\r\n    
    Forth of the greenwood are they gone,\r\n     Yea, all courageously,\r\n    
    Resolving to bring Stutely home,\r\n     Or every man to die.\r\n\r\nThe next
    day dawned bright and sunny. The whole face of nature seemed\r\ngay as if in
    despite of the tragedy which was soon to take place in the\r\nwalls of Nottingham
    town. The gates were not opened upon this day, for\r\nthe Sheriff was determined
    to carry through the hanging of Will Stutely\r\nundisturbed. No man, therefore,
    was to be allowed entrance from without,\r\nall that morning and until after
    the fatal hour of noon, when Will\u2019s\r\nsoul was to be launched into eternity.\r\n\r\nEarly
    in the day Robin had drawn his men to a point, as near as he\r\ndared, in the
    wood where he could watch the road leading to the East\r\ngate. He himself was
    clad in a bright scarlet dress, while his men, a\r\ngoodly array, wore their
    suits of sober Lincoln green. They were armed\r\nwith broadswords, and \u2018each
    man carried his bow and a full quiver of new\r\narrows, straightened and sharpened
    cunningly by Middle, the tinker. Over\r\ntheir greenwood dress, each man had
    thrown a rough mantle, making him\r\nlook not unlike a friar.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    hold it good, comrades,\u201D then said Robin Hood, \u201Cto tarry here in\r\nhiding
    for a season while we sent some one forth to obtain tidings.\r\nFor, in sooth,
    \u2018twill work no good to march upon the gates if they be\r\nclosed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLook,
    master,\u201D quoth one of the widow\u2019s sons. \u201CThere comes a palmer\r\nalong
    the road from the town. Belike he can tell us how the land ties,\r\nand if Stutely
    be really in jeopardy. Shall I go out and engage him in\r\nspeech?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGo,\u201D
    answered Robin.\r\n\r\nSo Stout Will went out from the band while the others
    hid themselves\r\nand waited. When he had come close to the palmer, who seemed
    a slight,\r\nyoungish man, he doffed his hat full courteously and said,\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    crave your pardon, holy man, but can you tell me tidings of\r\nNottingham town?
    Do they intend to put an outlaw to death this day?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYea,\u201D
    answered the palmer sadly. \u201C\u2018Tis true enough, sorry be the day.\r\nI
    have passed the very spot where the gallows-tree is going up. \u2018Tis out\r\nupon
    the roadway near the Sheriff\u2019s castle. One, Will Stutely, is to be\r\nhung
    thereon at noon, and I could not bear the sight, so came away.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    palmer spoke in a muffled voice; and as his hood was pulled well\r\nover his
    head, Stout Will could not discern what manner of man he was.\r\nOver his shoulder
    he carried a long staff, with the fashion of a little\r\ncross at one end; and
    he had sandaled feet like any monk. Stout Will\r\nnotice idly that the feet were
    very small and white, but gave no second\r\nthought to the matter.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    will shrive the poor wretch, if you have come away from him?\u201D he\r\nasked
    reproachfully.\r\n\r\nThe question seemed to put a new idea into the palmer\u2019s
    head. He turned\r\nso quickly that he almost dropped his hood.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo
    you think that I should undertake this holy office?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBy Saint
    Peter and the Blessed Virgin, I do indeed! Else, who will\r\ndo it? The Bishop
    and all his whining clerks may be there, but not one\r\nwould say a prayer for
    his soul.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I am only a poor palmer,\u201D the other began
    hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNathless, your prayers are as good as any and better
    than some,\u201D\r\n replied Will.\r\n\r\n\u201CRight gladly would I go,\u201D
    then said the palmer; \u201Cbut I fear me I cannot\r\nget into the city. You
    may know that the gates are fast locked, for this\r\nmorning, to all who would
    come in, although they let any pass out who\r\nwill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome
    with me,\u201D said Stout Will, \u201Cand my master will see that you pass\r\nthrough
    the gates.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the palmer pulled his cloak still closer about him
    and was brought\r\nbefore Robin Hood, to whom he told all he knew of the situation.
    He\r\nended with,\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I may make so bold, I would not try to enter
    the city from this\r\ngate, as \u2018tis closely guarded since yesterday. But
    on the far side, no\r\nattack is looked for.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy thanks, gentle
    palmer,\u201D quoth Robin, \u201Cyour suggestion is good, and\r\nwe will deploy
    to the gate upon the far side.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the men marched silently but quickly
    until they were near to the\r\nwestern gate. Then Arthur-a-Bland asked leave
    to go ahead as a scout,\r\nand quietly made his way to a point under the tower
    by the gate. The\r\nmoat was dry on this side, as these were times of peace,
    and Arthur was\r\nfurther favored by a stout ivy vine which grew out from an
    upper window.\r\n\r\nSwinging himself up boldly by means of this friendly vine,
    he crept\r\nthrough the window and in a moment more had sprung upon the warder
    from\r\nbehind and gripped him hard about the throat. The warder had no chance\r\nto
    utter the slightest sound, and soon lay bound and gagged upon the\r\nfloor; while
    Arthur-a-Bland slipped himself into his uniform and got\r\nhold of his keys.\r\n\r\n\u2018Twas
    the work of but a few moments more to open the gates, let down the\r\nbridge,
    and admit the rest of the band; and they lot inside the town so\r\nquietly that
    none knew of their coming. Fortune also favored them in the\r\nfact that just
    at this moment the prison doors had been opened for\r\nthe march of the condemned
    man, and every soldier and idle lout in the\r\nmarket-lace had trooped thither
    to see him pass along.\r\n\r\nPresently out came Will Stutely with firm step
    but dejected air. He\r\nlooked eagerly to the right hand and to the left, but
    saw none of the\r\nband. And though more than one curious face betrayed friendship
    in it,\r\nhe knew there could be no aid from such source.\r\n\r\nWill\u2019s
    hands were tied behind his back. He marched between rows of\r\nsoldiery, and
    the Sheriff and the Bishop brought up the rear on horses,\r\nlooking mightily
    puffed up and important over the whole proceeding. He\r\nwould show these sturdy
    rebels--would the Sheriff--whose word was law!\r\nHe knew that the gates were
    tightly fastened; and further he believed\r\nthat the outlaws would hardly venture
    again within the walls, even if\r\nthe gates were open. And as he looked around
    at the fivescore archers\r\nand pikemen who lined the way to the gallows, he
    smiled with grim\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nSeeing that no help was nigh, the prisoner
    paused at the foot of the\r\nscaffold and spoke in a firm tone to the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    lord Sheriff,\u201D quoth he, \u201Csince I must needs die, grant me one boon;\r\nfor
    my noble master ne\u2019er yet had a man that was hanged on a tree:\r\n\r\n    
    Give me a sword all in my hand,\r\n     And let me be unbound,\r\n     And with
    thee and thy men will I fight\r\n     Till I lie dead on the ground.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    the Sheriff would by no means listen to his request; but swore\r\nthat he should
    be hanged a shameful death, and not die by the sword\r\nvaliantly.\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CO no, no, no,\u201D the Sheriff said,\r\n     \u201CThou shalt on the gallows
    die,\r\n     Aye, and so shall they master too,\r\n     If ever it in me lie.\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    \u201CO dastard coward!\u201D Stutely cried,\r\n     \u201CFaint-hearted peasant
    slave!\r\n     If ever my master do thee meet,\r\n     Thou shalt thy payment
    have!\u201D\r\n\r\n     \u201CMy noble master thee doth scorn,\r\n     And all
    thy cowardly crew,\r\n     Such silly imps unable are\r\n     Bold Robin to subdue.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis
    brave speech was not calculated to soothe the Sheriff. \u201CTo the\r\ngallows
    with him!\u201D he roared, giving a sign to the hangman; and Stutely\r\nwas pushed
    into the rude cart which was to bear him under the gallows\r\nuntil his neck
    was leashed. Then the cart would be drawn roughly away\r\nand the unhappy man
    would swing out over the tail of it into another\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut at this
    moment came a slight interruption. A boyish-looking palmer\r\nstepped forth,
    and said:\r\n\r\n\u201CYour Excellency, let me at least shrive this poor wretch\u2019s
    soul ere it\r\nbe hurled into eternity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D shouted
    the Sheriff, \u201Clet him die a dog\u2019s death!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen his
    damnation will rest upon you,\u201D said the monk firmly. \u201CYou, my\r\nlord
    Bishop, cannot stand by and see this wrong done.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Bishop hesitated.
    Like the Sheriff, he wanted no delay; but\r\nthe people were beginning to mutter
    among themselves and move about\r\nuneasily. He said a few words to the Sheriff,
    and the latter nodded to\r\nthe monk ungraciously.\r\n\r\n\u201CPerform your
    duty, Sir Priest,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand be quick about it!\u201D Then\r\nturning
    to his soldiers. \u201CWatch this palmer narrowly,\u201D he commanded.\r\n\u201CBelike
    he is in league with those rascally outlaws.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut the palmer paid
    no heed to his last words. He began to tell his\r\nbeads quickly, and to speak
    in a low voice to the condemned man. But he\r\ndid not touch his bonds.\r\n\r\nThen
    came another stir in the crowd, and one came pushing through the\r\npress of
    people and soldiery to come near to the scaffold.\r\n\r\n\u201CI pray you, Will,
    before you die, take leave of all your friends!\u201D\r\n cried out the well-known
    voice of Much, the miller\u2019s son.\r\n\r\nAt the word the palmer stepped back
    suddenly and looked to one side. The\r\nSheriff also knew the speaker.\r\n\r\n\u201CSeize
    him!\u201D he shouted. \u201C\u2018Tis another of the crew. He is the villain\r\ncook
    who once did rob me of my silver plate. We\u2019ll make a double hanging\r\nof
    this!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot so fast, good master Sheriff,\u201D retorted Much.
    \u201CFirst catch your man\r\nand then hang him. But meanwhile I would like to
    borrow my friend of you\r\nawhile.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with one stroke of his keen
    hunting-knife he cut the bonds which\r\nfastened the prisoner\u2019s arms, and
    Stutely leaped lightly from the cart.\r\n\r\n\u201CTreason!\u201D screamed the
    Sheriff, getting black with rage. \u201CCatch the\r\nvarlets!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    saying he spurred his horse fiercely forward, and rising in his\r\nstirrups brought
    down his sword with might and main at Much\u2019s head. But\r\nhis former cook
    dodged nimbly underneath the horse and came up on the\r\nother side, while the
    weapon whistled harmlessly in the air.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, Sir Sheriff!\u201D he
    cried, \u201CI must e\u2019en borrow your sword for the\r\nfriend I have borrowed.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon
    he snatched the weapon deftly from the Sheriff\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere,
    Stutely!\u201D said he, \u201Cthe Sheriff has lent you his own sword. Back\r\nto
    back with me, man, and we\u2019ll teach these knaves a trick or two!\u201D\r\n\r\nMeanwhile
    the soldiers had recovered from their momentary surprise and\r\nhad flung themselves
    into the fray. A clear bugle-note had also sounded\r\nthe same which the soldiers
    had learned to dread. \u2018Twas the rallying\r\nnote of the green wood men.\r\n\r\nCloth
    yard shafts began to hurtle through the air, and Robin and his men\r\ncast aside
    their cloaks and sprang forward crying:\r\n\r\n\u201CLockesley! Lockesley! a
    rescue! a rescue!\u201D\r\n\r\nOn the instant, a terrible scene of hand to hand
    fighting followed. The\r\nSheriff\u2019s men, though once more taken by surprise,
    were determined to\r\nsell this rescue dearly. They packed in closely and stubbornly
    about\r\nthe condemned man and Much and the palmer, and it was only by desperate\r\nrushes
    that the foresters made an opening in the square. Ugly cuts and\r\nbruises were
    exchanged freely; and lucky was the man who escaped with\r\nonly these. Many
    of the onlookers, who had long hated the Sheriff and\r\nfelt sympathy for Robin\u2019s
    men, also plunged into the conflict--although\r\nthey could not well keep out
    of it, in sooth!--and aided the rescuers no\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nAt last with a
    mighty onrush, Robin cleaved a way through the press to\r\nthe scaffold itself,
    and not a second too soon; for two men with pikes\r\nhad leaped upon the cart,
    and were in the act of thrusting down upon the\r\npalmer and Will Stutely. A
    mighty upward blow from Robin\u2019s good blade\r\nsent the pike flying from
    the hand of one, while a well-directed arrow\r\nfrom the outskirt pierced the
    other fellow\u2019s throat.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod save you, master!\u201D cried Will
    Stutely joyfully. \u201CI had begun to\r\nfear that I would never see your face
    again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA rescue!\u201D shouted the outlaws afresh, and the
    soldiery became\r\nfainthearted and \u2018gan to give back. But the field was
    not yet won, for\r\nthey retreated in close order toward the East gate, resolved
    to hem\r\nthe attackers within the city walls. Here again, however, they were
    in\r\nerror, since the outlaws did not go out by their nearest gate. They\r\nmade
    a sally in that direction, in order to mislead the soldiery, then\r\nabruptly
    turned and headed for the West gate, which was still guarded by\r\nArthur-a-Bland.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff\u2019s men raised an exultant shout at this, thinking they had\r\nthe
    enemy trapped. Down they charged after them, but the outlaws made\r\ngood their
    lead, and soon got through the gate and over the bridge which\r\nhad been let
    down by Arthur-a-Bland.\r\n\r\nClose upon their heels came the soldiers--so close,
    that Arthur had no\r\ntime to close the gate again or raise the bridge. So he
    threw away his\r\nkey and fell in with the yeomen, who now began their retreat
    up the long\r\nhill to the woods.\r\n\r\nOn this side the town, the road leading
    to the forest was long and\r\nalmost unprotected. The greenwood men were therefore
    in some distress,\r\nfor the archers shot at them from loop-holes in the walls,
    and the\r\npikemen were reinforced by a company of mounted men from the castle.
    But\r\nthe outlaws retreated stubbornly and now and again turned to hold their\r\npursuers
    at bay by a volley of arrows. Stutely was in their midst,\r\nfighting with the
    energy of two; and the little palmer was there also,\r\nbut took no part save
    to keep close to Robin\u2019s side and mutter silent\r\nwords as though in prayer.\r\n\r\nRobin
    put his horn to his lips to sound a rally, when a flying arrow\r\nfrom the enemy
    pierced his hand. The palmer gave a little cry and sprang\r\nforward. The Sheriff,
    who followed close with the men on horseback, also\r\nsaw the wound and gave
    a great huzza.\r\n\r\n\u201CHa! you will shoot no more bows for a season, master
    outlaw!\u201D he\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou lie!\u201D retorted Robin fiercely,
    wrenching the shaft from his hand\r\ndespite the streaming blood; \u201CI have
    saved one shot for you all this\r\nday. Here take it!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd he fitted
    the same arrow, which had wounded him, upon the string\r\nof his bow and let
    it fly toward the Sheriff\u2019s head. The Sheriff fell\r\nforward upon his horse
    in mortal terror, but not so quickly as to escape\r\nunhurt. The sharp point
    laid bare a deep gash upon his scalp and must\r\ncertainly have killed him if
    it had come closer.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Sheriff discomfited his followers
    for the moment, and\r\nRobin\u2019s men took this chance to speed on up the hill.
    The palmer had\r\nwhipped out a small white handkerchief and tried to staunch
    Robin\u2019s\r\nwound as they went. At sight of the palmer\u2019s hand, Robin
    turned with a\r\nstart, and pushed back the other\u2019s hood.\r\n\r\n\u201CMarian!\u201D
    he exclaimed, \u201Cyou here!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Maid Marian, who had
    helped save Will, and been in the\r\nstress of battle from the first. Now she
    hung her head as though caught\r\nin wrong.\r\n\r\n\u201CI had to come, Robin,\u201D
    she said simply, \u201Cand I knew you would not let\r\nme come, else.\u201D\r\n\r\nTheir
    further talk was interrupted by an exclamation from Will Scarlet.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy
    the saints, we are trapped!\u201D he said, and pointed to the top of the\r\nhill,
    toward which they were pressing.\r\n\r\nThere from out a gray castle poured a
    troop of men, armed with pikes and\r\naxes, who shouted and came running down
    upon them. At the same instant,\r\nthe Sheriff\u2019s men also renewed the pursuit.\r\n\r\n\u201CAlas!\u201D
    cried poor Marian, \u201Cwe are undone! There is no way of escape!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCourage,
    dear heart!\u201D said Robin, drawing her close to him. But his own\r\nspirit
    sank as he looked about for some outlet.\r\n\r\nThen--oh, joyful sight!--he recognized
    among the foremost of those\r\ncoming from the castle the once doleful knight,
    Sir Richard of the Lea.\r\nHe was smiling now, and greatly excited.\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    Hood! a Hood!\u201D he cried; \u201Ca rescue! a rescue!\u201D Never were there
    more\r\nwelcome sights and sounds than these. With a great cheer the outlaws\r\nraced
    up the hill to meet their new friends; and soon the whole force\r\nhad gained
    the shelter of the castle. Bang! went the bridge as it swung\r\nback, with great
    clanking of chains. Clash! went one great door upon the\r\nother, as they shut
    in the outlaw band, and shut out the Sheriff, who\r\ndashed up at the head of
    his men, his bandaged face streaked with blood\r\nand inflamed with rage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XXI\r\n\r\nHOW SIR RICHARD OF THE LEA REPAID HIS DEBT\r\n\r\n     The proud Sheriff
    loud \u2018gan cry\r\n     And said, \u201CThou traitor knight,\r\n     Thou
    keepest here the king\u2019s enemy\r\n     Against the laws and right.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COpen
    the gate!\u201D shouted the Sheriff hoarsely, to the sentinel upon the\r\nwalls.
    \u201COpen, I say, in the king\u2019s name!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy who are you
    to come thus brawling upon my premises?\u201D asked a\r\nhaughty voice; and Sir
    Richard himself stepped forth upon the turret.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou know me well,
    traitor knight!\u201D said the Sheriff, \u201Cnow give up into\r\nmy hands the
    enemy of the King whom you have sheltered against the laws\r\nand right.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFair
    and softly, sir,\u201D quoth the knight smoothly. \u201CI well avow that\r\nI
    have done certain deeds this day. But I have done them upon mine\r\nown land,
    which you now trespass upon; and I shall answer only to the\r\nKing--whom God
    preserve!--for my actions.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThou soft-spoken villain!\u201D
    said the Sheriff, still in a towering\r\npassion. \u201CI, also, serve the King;
    and if these outlaws are not given up\r\nto me at once, I shall lay siege to
    the castle and burn it with fire.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFirst show me your warrants,\u201D
    said Sir Richard curtly.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy word is enough! Am I not Sheriff of
    Nottingham?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you are, in sooth,\u201D retorted the knight,
    \u201Cyou should know that you\r\nhave no authority within my lands unless you
    bear the King\u2019s order. In\r\nthe meantime, go mend your manners, lording.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    Sir Richard snapped his fingers and disappeared from the walls. The\r\nSheriff,
    after lingering a few moments longer in hope of further parley,\r\nwas forced
    to withdraw, swearing fiercely.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe King\u2019s order!\u201D muttered
    he. \u201CThat shall I have without delay,\r\nas well as this upstart knight\u2019s
    estates; for King Richard is lately\r\nreturned, I hear, from the Holy Land.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeanwhile
    the knight had gone back to Robin Hood, and the two men\r\ngreeted each other
    right gladly. \u201CWell met, bold Robin!\u201D cried he,\r\ntaking him in his
    arms. \u201CWell met, indeed! The Lord has lately prospered\r\nme, and I was
    minded this day to ride forth and repay my debt to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    so you have,\u201D answered Robin gaily.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, \u2018twas nothing--this
    small service!\u201D said the knight. \u201CI meant the\r\nmoneys coming to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    have all been repaid,\u201D said Robin; \u201Cmy lord of Hereford himself\r\ngave
    them to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe exact sum?\u201D asked the knight.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    exact sum,\u201D answered Robin, winking solemnly.\r\n\r\nSir Richard smiled,
    but said no more at the time. Robin was made to rest\r\nuntil dinner should be
    served. Meanwhile a leech bound up his hand with\r\nointment, promising him that
    he should soon have its use again. Some\r\nhalfscore others of the yeomen had
    been hurt in the fight, but luckily\r\nnone of grave moment. They were all bandaged
    and made happy by bumpers\r\nof ale.\r\n\r\nAt dinner Sir Richard presented Robin
    to his wife and son. The lady was\r\nstately and gracious, and made much of Marian,
    whom she had known as\r\na little girl and who was now clothed more seemly for
    a dinner than in\r\nmonkish garments. The young esquire was a goodly youth and
    bade fair to\r\nmake as stout a knight as his father.\r\n\r\nThe feast was a
    joyous event. There were two long tables, and two\r\nhundred men sat down at
    them, and ate and drank and afterward sang\r\nsongs. An hundred and forty of
    these men wore Lincoln green and called\r\nRobin Hood their chief. Never, I ween,
    had there been a more gallant\r\ncompany at table in Lea Castle!\r\n\r\nThat
    night the foresters tarried within the friendly walls, and the next\r\nday took
    leave; though Sir Richard protested that they should have made\r\na longer stay.
    And he took Robin aside to his strong room and pressed\r\nhim again to take the
    four hundred golden pounds. But his guest was\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep the
    money, for it is your own,\u201D said Robin; \u201CI have but made the\r\nBishop
    return that which he extorted unjustly.\u201D\r\n\r\nSir Richard thanked him
    in a few earnest words, and asked him and all\r\nhis men to visit the armory,
    before they departed. And therein they saw,\r\nplaced apart, an hundred and forty
    stout yew bows of cunning make, with\r\nfine waxen silk strings; and an hundred
    and forty sheaves of arrows.\r\nEvery shaft was a just ell long, set with peacock\u2019s
    feathers, and\r\nnotched with silver. And Sir Richard\u2019s fair lady came forward
    and with\r\nher own hands gave each yeoman a bow and a sheaf.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn
    sooth, these are poor presents we have made you, good Robin Hood,\u201D\r\n said
    Sir Richard; \u201Cbut they carry with them a thousand times their\r\nweight
    in gratitude.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff made good his threat to inform the King.
    Forth rode he\r\nto London town upon the week following, his scalp wound having
    healed\r\nsufficiently to permit him to travel. This time he did not seek out\r\nPrince
    John, but asked audience with King Richard of the Lion Heart\r\nhimself. His
    Majesty had but lately returned from the crusades, and was\r\njust then looking
    into the state of his kingdom. So the Sheriff found\r\nready audience.\r\n\r\nThen
    to him the Sheriff spoke at length concerning Robin Hood; how that\r\nfor many
    months the outlaws had defied the King, and slain the King\u2019s\r\ndeer; how
    Robin had gathered about him the best archers in all the\r\ncountryside; and,
    finally, how the traitorous knight Sir Richard of the\r\nLea had rescued the
    band when capture seemed certain, and refused to\r\ndeliver them up to justice.\r\n\r\nThe
    King heard him through with attention and quoth he:\r\n\r\n\u201CMeseems I have
    heard of this same Robin Hood, and his men, and also\r\nseen somewhat of their
    prowess. Did not these same outlaws shoot in a\r\nroyal Tourney at Finsbury field?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    did, Your Majesty, under a royal amnesty.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn this speech the Sheriff
    erred, for the King asked quickly,\r\n\r\n\u201CHow came they last to the Fair
    at Nottingham--by stealth?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, Your Majesty.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid
    you forbid them to come?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, Your Majesty. That is--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSpeak
    out!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor the good of the shire,\u201D began the Sheriff again,
    falteringly,\r\n\u201Cwe did proclaim an amnesty; but \u2018twas because these
    men had proved a\r\nmenace--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by my halidom!\u201D quoth
    the King, while his brow grew black. \u201CSuch\r\ntreachery would be unknown
    in the camp of the Saracen; and yet we call\r\nourselves a Christian people!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Sheriff kept silence through very fear and shame; then the King\r\nbegan speech
    again:\r\n\r\n\u201CNathless, my lord Sheriff, we promise to look into this matter.
    Those\r\noutlaws must be taught that there is but one King in England, and that\r\nhe
    stands for the law.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the Sheriff was dismissed, with very mixed
    feelings, and went his way\r\nhome to Nottingham town. A fortnight later the
    King began to make good\r\nhis word, by riding with a small party of knights
    to Lea Castle. Sir\r\nRichard was advised of the cavalcade\u2019s approach, and
    quickly recognized\r\nhis royal master in the tall knight who rode in advance.
    Hasting to open\r\nwide his castle gates he went forth to meet the King and fell
    on one\r\nknee and kissed his stirrup. For Sir Richard, also, had been with the\r\nKing
    to the Holy Land, and they had gone on many adventurous quests\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe
    King bade him rise, and dismounted from his own horse to greet him\r\nas a brother
    in arms; and arm-in-arm they went into the castle, while\r\nbugles and trumpets
    sounded forth joyous welcome in honor of the great\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nAfter
    the King had rested and supped, he turned upon the knight and with\r\ngrave face
    inquired:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is this I hear about your castle\u2019s becoming
    a nest and harbor for\r\noutlaws?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sir Richard of the Lea, divining
    that the Sheriff had been at the\r\nKing\u2019s ear with his story, made a clean
    breast of all he knew; how that\r\nthe outlaws had befriended him in sore need--as
    they had befriended\r\nothers--and how that he had given them only knightly protection
    in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe King liked the story well, for his own soul was one
    of chivalry.\r\nAnd he asked other questions about Robin Hood, and heard of the
    ancient\r\nwrong done his father before him, and of Robin\u2019s own enemies,
    and of his\r\nmanner of living.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn sooth,\u201D cried King Richard,
    springing up, \u201CI must see this bold\r\nfellow for myself! An you will entertain
    my little company, and be ready\r\nto sally forth, upon the second day, in quest
    of me if need were, I\r\nshall e\u2019en fare alone into the greenwood to seek
    an adventure with him.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut of this adventure you shall be told in
    the next tale; for I have\r\nalready shown you how Sir Richard of the Lea repaid
    his debt, with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nHOW KING RICHARD
    CAME TO SHERWOOD FOREST\r\n\r\n     King Richard hearing of the pranks\r\n    
    Of Robin Hood and his men,\r\n     He much admired and more desired\r\n     To
    see both him and them.\r\n\r\n     Then Robin takes a can of ale:\r\n     \u201CCome
    let us now begin;\r\n     And every man shall have his can;\r\n     Here\u2019s
    a health unto the King!\u201D\r\n\r\nFriar Tuck had nursed Little John\u2019s
    wounded knee so skilfully that it\r\nwas now healed. In sooth, the last part
    of the nursing depended more\r\nupon strength than skill; for it consisted chiefly
    of holding down the\r\npatient, by main force, to his cot. Little John had felt
    so well that he\r\nhad insisted upon getting up before the wound was healed;
    and he would\r\nhave done so, if the friar had not piled some holy books upon
    his legs\r\nand sat upon his stomach.\r\n\r\nUnder this vigorous treatment Little
    John was constrained to lie quiet\r\nuntil the friar gave him leave to get up.
    At last he had this leave, and\r\nhe and the friar went forth to join the rest
    of the band, who were right\r\nglad to see them, you may be sure. They sat around
    a big fire, for \u2018twas\r\na chilly evening, and they feasted and made merry,
    in great content.\r\n\r\nA cold rain set in, later, but the friar wended his
    way back, nathless,\r\nto his little hermitage. There he made himself a cheerful
    blaze, and\r\nchanged his dripping robe, and had sat himself down, with a sigh
    of\r\nsatisfaction, before a tankard of hot mulled wine and a pasty, when\r\nsuddenly
    a voice was heard on the outside, demanding admission. His\r\nkennel of dogs
    set up furious uproar, on the instant, by way of proving\r\nthe fact of a stranger\u2019s
    presence.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow by Saint Peter!\u201D growled the friar, \u201Cwho
    comes here at this\r\nunseemly hour? Does he take this for a hostelry? Move on,
    friend, else\r\nmy mulled wine will get cold!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo saying he put the
    tankard to his lips, when a thundering rap sounded\r\nupon the door-panel, making
    it to quiver, and causing Tuck almost to\r\ndrop his tankard; while an angry
    voice shouted, \u201CHo! Within there! Open,\r\nI say!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGo
    your way in peace!\u201D roared back the friar; \u201CI can do nothing for\r\nyou.
    \u2018Tis but a few miles to Gamewell, if you know the road.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    I do not know the road, and if I did I would not budge another\r\nfoot. \u2018Tis
    wet without and dry within. So open, without further parley!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    murrain seize you for disturbing a holy man in his prayers!\u201D muttered\r\nTuck
    savagely. Nathless, he was fain to unbar the door in order to\r\nkeep it from
    being battered down. Then lighting a torch at his fire and\r\nwhistling for one
    of his dogs, he strode forth to see who his visitor\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nThe figure
    of a tall knight clad in a black coat of mail, with plumed\r\nhelmet, stood before
    him. By his side stood his horse, also caparisoned\r\nin rich armor.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave
    you no supper, brother?\u201D asked the Black Knight curtly. \u201CI must\r\nbeg
    of you a bed and a bit of roof, for this night, and fain would\r\nrefresh my
    body ere I sleep.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have no room that even your steed would
    deign to accept, Sir Knight;\r\nand naught save a crust of bread and pitcher
    of water.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019 faith, I can smell better fare than that,
    brother, and must e\u2019en\r\nforce my company upon you, though I shall recompense
    it for gold in the\r\nname of the church. As for my horse, let him but be blanketed
    and put on\r\nthe sheltered side of the house.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd without further
    parley the knight boldly strode past Tuck and his\r\ndog and entered the hermitage.
    Something about his masterful air pleased\r\nTuck, in spite of his churlishness.\r\n\r\n\u201CSit
    you down, Sir Knight,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand I will fasten up up your\r\nsteed,
    and find him somewhat in the shape of grain. Half, also, of my\r\nbed and board
    is yours, this night; but we shall see later who is the\r\nbetter man, and is
    to give the orders!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWith all my soul!\u201D said the knight,
    laughing. \u201CI can pay my keeping in\r\nblows or gold as you prefer.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    friar presently returned and drew up a small table near the fire.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,
    Sir Knight,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cput off your sword and helm and such other\r\nwar-gear
    as it pleases you, and help me lay this table, for I am passing\r\nhungry.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    knight did as he was told, and put aside the visor which had hid\r\nhis face.
    He was a bronzed and bearded man with blue eyes, and hair shot\r\nwith gold,
    haughty but handsome withal.\r\n\r\nThen once again the priest sat him down to
    his pasty and mulled wine,\r\nright hopefully. He spoke his grace with some haste,
    and was surprised\r\nto hear his guest respond fittingly in the Latin tongue.
    Then they\r\nattacked the wine and pasty valiantly, and the Black Knight made
    good\r\nhis word of being in need of refreshment. Tuck looked ruefully at the\r\nrapidly
    disappearing food, but came to grudge it not, by reason of the\r\nstories with
    which his guest enlivened the meal. The wine and warmth of\r\nthe room had cheered
    them both, and they were soon laughing uproariously\r\nas the best of comrades
    in the world. The Black Knight, it seemed, had\r\ntraveled everywhere. He had
    been on crusades, had fought the courteous\r\nSaladin, had been in prison, and
    often in peril. But now he spoke of\r\nit lightly, and laughed it off, and made
    himself so friendly that Friar\r\nTuck was like to choke with merriment. So passed
    the time till late; and\r\nthe two fell asleep together, one on each side of
    the table which had\r\nbeen cleared to the platters.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Friar
    Tuck awoke disposed to be surly, but was speedily\r\nmollified by the sight of
    the Black Knight, who had already risen gay as\r\na lark, washed his face and
    hands, and was now stirring a hot gruel over\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy my
    faith, I make a sorry host!\u201D cried Tuck springing to his feet.\r\nAnd later
    as they sat at breakfast, he added, \u201CI want not your gold, of\r\nwhich you
    spoke last night; but instead I will do what I can to speed\r\nyou on your way
    whenever you wish to depart.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen tell me,\u201D said the
    knight, \u201Chow I may find Robin Hood the outlaw;\r\nfor I have a message to
    him from the King. All day yesterday I sought\r\nhim, but found him not.\u201D\r\n\r\nFriar
    Tuck lifted up his hands in holy horror. \u201CI am a lover of peace,\r\nSir
    Knight, and do not consort with Robin\u2019s bold fellows.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    I think no harm of Master Hood,\u201D said the knight; \u201Cbut much I\r\nyearn
    to have speed with him in mine own person.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf that be all,
    mayhap I can guide you to his haunts,\u201D said Tuck, who\r\nforesaw in this
    knight a possible gold-bag for Robin. \u201CIn sooth, I could\r\nnot well live
    in these woods without hearing somewhat of the outlaws;\r\nbut matters of religion
    are my chief joy and occupation.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will go with you, brother,\u201D
    said the Black Knight.\r\n\r\nSo without more ado they went their way into the
    forest, the knight\r\nriding upon his charger, and Tuck pacing along demurely
    by his side.\r\n\r\nThe day had dawned clear and bright, and now with the sun
    a good three\r\nhours high a sweet autumn fragrance was in the air. The wind
    had just\r\nthat touch of coolness in it which sets the hunter\u2019s blood to
    tingling;\r\nand every creature of nature seemed bounding with joyous life.\r\n\r\nThe
    knight sniffed the fresh air in delight.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy my halidom!\u201D quoth
    he; \u201Cbut the good greenwood is the best place\r\nto live in, after all!
    What court or capital can equal this, for\r\nfull-blooded men?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNone
    of this earth,\u201D replied Tuck smilingly. And once more his heart\r\nwarmed
    toward the courteous stranger.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded more than three
    or four miles along the way from\r\nFountain Abbey to Barnesdale, when of a sudden
    the bushes just ahead of\r\nthem parted and a well-knit man with curling brown
    hair stepped into the\r\nroad and laid his hand upon the knight\u2019s bridle.\r\n\r\nIt
    was Robin Hood. He had seen Friar Tuck, a little way back, and\r\nshrewdly suspected
    his plan. Tuck, however, feigned not to know him at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold!\u201D
    cried Robin; \u201CI am in charge of the highway this day, and must\r\nexact
    an accounting from all passersby.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is it bids me hold?\u201D
    asked the knight quietly. \u201CI am not i\u2019 the\r\nhabit of yielding to
    one man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen here are others to keep me company,\u201D said
    Robin clapping his\r\nhands. And instantly a half-score other stalwart fellows
    came out of the\r\nbushes and stood beside him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe be yeomen of
    the forest, Sir Knight,\u201D continued Robin, \u201Cand live\r\nunder the greenwood
    tree. We have no means of support--thanks to the\r\ntyranny of our over-lords--other
    than the aid which fat churchmen and\r\ngoodly knights like yourselves can give.
    And as ye have churches and\r\nrents, both, and gold in great plenty, we beseech
    ye for Saint Charity\r\nto give us some of your spending.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am but a poor monk, good sir!\u201D said Friar Tuck in a whining voice,\r\n\u201Cand
    am on my way to the shrine of Saint Dunstan, if your worshipfulness\r\nwill permit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTarry
    a space with us,\u201D answered Robin, biting back a smile, \u201Cand we\r\nwill
    speed you on your way.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Black Knight now spoke again. \u201CBut
    we are messengers of the King,\u201D\r\n quoth he; \u201CHis Majesty himself
    tarries near here and would have speech\r\nwith Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    save the King!\u201D said Robin, doffing his cap loyally; \u201Cand all that\r\nwish
    him well! I am Robin Hood, but I say cursed be the man who denies\r\nour liege
    King\u2019s sovereignty!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave a care!\u201D said the knight,
    \u201Cor you shall curse yourself!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, not so,\u201D replied
    Robin curtly; \u201Cthe King has no more devoted\r\nsubject than I. Nor have
    I despoiled aught of his save, mayhap, a few\r\ndeer for my hunger. My chief
    war is against the clergy and barons of the\r\nland who bear down upon the poor.
    But I am glad,\u201D he continued, \u201Cthat I\r\nhave met you here; and before
    we end you shall be my friend and taste of\r\nour greenwood cheer.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    what is the reckoning?\u201D asked the knight. \u201CFor I am told that some\r\nof
    your feasts are costly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,\u201D responded Robin waving
    his hands, \u201Cyou are from the King.\r\nNathless--how much money is in your
    purse?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have no more than forty gold pieces, seeing that
    I have lain a\r\nfortnight at Nottingham with the King, and have spent some goodly\r\namounts
    upon other lordings,\u201D replied the knight.\r\n\r\nRobin took the forty pounds
    and gravely counted it. One half he gave to\r\nhis men and bade them drink the
    King\u2019s health with it. The other half he\r\nhanded back to the knight.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D
    said he courteously, \u201Chave this for your spending. If you lie\r\nwith kings
    and lordings overmuch, you are like to need it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGramercy!\u201D
    replied the other smiling. \u201CAnd now lead on to your\r\ngreenwood hostelry.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    Robin went on the one side of the knight\u2019s steed, and Friar Tuck on\r\nthe
    other, and the men went before and behind till they came to the open\r\nglade
    before the caves of Barnesdale. Then Robin drew forth his bugle\r\nand winded
    the three signal blasts of the band. Soon there came a\r\ncompany of yeomen with
    its leader, and another, and a third, and a\r\nfourth, till there were sevenscore
    yeomen in sight. All were dressed\r\nin new livery of Lincoln green, and carried
    new bows in their hands and\r\nbright short swords at their belts. And every
    man bent his knee to Robin\r\nHood ere taking his place before the board, which
    was already set.\r\n\r\nA handsome dark-haired page stood at Robin\u2019s right
    hand to pour his wine\r\nand that of the knightly guest; while the knight marveled
    much at all he\r\nsaw, and said within himself:\r\n\r\n\u201CThese men of Robin
    Hood\u2019s give him more obedience than my fellows give\r\nto me.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt
    the signal from Robin the dinner began. There was venison and fowl\r\nand fish
    and wheaten cake and ale and red wine in great plenty, and\r\n\u2018twas a goodly
    sight to see the smiles upon the hungry yeomen\u2019s faces.\r\n\r\nFirst they
    listened to an unctuous grace from Friar Tuck, and then Robin\r\nlifted high
    a tankard of ale.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, let us now begin,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand
    every man shall have his can.\r\nIn honor of our guest who comes with royal word,
    here\u2019s a health unto\r\nthe King!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe guest responded heartily
    to this toast, and round about the board it\r\nwent, the men cheering noisily
    for King Richard!\r\n\r\nAfter the feast was over, Robin turned to his guest
    and said, \u201CNow you\r\nshall see what life we lead, so that you may report
    faithfully, for good\r\nor bad, unto the King.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo at a signal from
    him, the men rose up and smartly bent their bows for\r\npractice, while the knight
    was greatly astonished at the smallness of\r\nthe their targets. A wand was set
    up, far down the glade, and thereon\r\nwas balanced a garland of roses. Whosoever
    failed to speed his shaft\r\nthrough the garland, without knocking it off the
    wand, was to submit to\r\na buffet from the hand of Friar Tuck.\r\n\r\n\u201CHo,
    ho!\u201D cried the knight, as his late traveling companion rose up and\r\nbared
    his brawny arm ready for service; \u201Cso you, my friend, are Friar\r\nTuck!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have not gainsaid it,\u201D replied Tuck growling at having betrayed\r\nhimself.
    \u201CBut chastisement is a rule of the church, and I am seeking the\r\ngood
    of these stray sheep.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe knight said no more, though his eyes twinkled;
    and the shooting\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nDavid of Doncaster shot first and landed safely
    through the rose\r\ngarland. Then came Allan-a-Dale and Little John and Stutely
    and Scarlet\r\nand many of the rest, while the knight held his breath from very\r\namazement.
    Each fellow shot truly through the garland, until Middle the\r\ntinker--not to
    be outdone--stepped up for a trial. But alas! while\r\nhe made a fair shot for
    a townsman, the arrow never came within a\r\nhand-breath of the outer rim of
    the garland.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome hither, fellow,\u201D said Little John coaxingly.
    \u201CThe priest would\r\nbless thee with his open hand.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen because
    Middle made a wry face, as though he had already received\r\nthe buffet, and
    loitered in his steps, Arthur-a-Bland and Will Stutely\r\nseized him by the arms
    and stood him before the friar. Tuck\u2019s big arm\r\nflashed through the air--\u201Cwhoof!\u201D
    and stopped suddenly against the\r\ntinker\u2019s ear; while Middle himself went
    rolling over and over on the\r\ngrass. He was stopped by a small bush, and up
    he sat, thrusting his head\r\nthrough it, rubbing his ear and blinking up at
    the sky as though the\r\nstars had fallen and struck him. The yeomen roared with
    merriment, and\r\nas for the knight, he laughed till the tears came out of his
    blue eyes\r\nand rolled down his face.\r\n\r\nAfter Middle\u2019s mishap, others
    of the band seemed to lose their balance,\r\nand fared in the same fashion. The
    garland would topple over in a most\r\nimpish way at every breath, although the
    arrows went through it. So\r\nMiddle \u2018gan to feel better when he saw this
    one and that one tumbling on\r\nthe sward.\r\n\r\nAt last came Robin\u2019s turn.
    He shot carefully, but as ill luck would have\r\nit the shaft was ill-feathered
    and swerved sidewise so that it missed\r\nthe garland by full three fingers.
    Then a great roar went up from the\r\nwhole company; for \u2018twas rare that
    they saw their leader miss his mark.\r\nRobin flung his bow upon the ground from
    very vexation.\r\n\r\n\u201CA murrain take it!\u201D quoth he. \u201CThe arrow
    was sadly winged. I felt the\r\npoor feather upon it as it left my fingers!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    suddenly seizing his bow again, he sped three shafts as fast as he\r\ncould sent
    them, and every one went clean through the garland.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy Saint George!\u201D
    muttered the knight. \u201CNever before saw I such\r\nshooting in all Christendom!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    band cheered heartily at these last shots; but Will Scarlet came up\r\ngravely
    to Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CPretty shooting, master!\u201D quoth he, \u201Cbut \u2018twill
    not save you from\r\npaying for the bad arrow. So walk up and take your medicine!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    that may not be!\u201D protested Robin. \u201CThe good friar belongs to\r\nmy
    company and has no authority to lift hands against me. But you, Sir\r\nKnight,
    stand as it were for the King. I pray you, serve out my blow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot
    so!\u201D said Friar Tuck. \u201CMy son, you forget I stand for the church,\r\nwhich
    is greater even than the King.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot in merry England,\u201D
    said the knight in a deep voice. Then rising to\r\nhis feet, he added, \u201CI
    stand ready to serve you, Master Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow out upon ye for
    an upstart knight!\u201D cried Friar Tuck. \u201CI told you\r\nlast night, sirrah,
    that we should yet see who was the better man! So we\r\nwill e\u2019en prove
    it now, and thus settle who is to pay Robin Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood!\u201D
    said Robin, \u201Cfor I want not to start a dispute between church\r\nand state.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood!\u201D
    also said the knight. \u201C\u2018Tis an easy way to end prattling. Come,\r\nfriar,
    strike and ye dare. I will give you first blow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have the
    advantage of an iron pot on your head and gloves on your\r\nhands,\u201D said
    the friar; \u201Cbut have at ye! Down you shall go, if you were\r\nGoliath of
    Gath.\u201D\r\n\r\nOnce more the priest\u2019s brawny arm flashed through the
    air, and struck\r\nwith a \u201Cwhoof!\u201D But to the amazement of all, the
    knight did not budge\r\nfrom his tracks, though the upper half of his body swerved
    slightly to\r\nease the force of the blow. A loud shout burst from the yeomen
    at this,\r\nfor the friar\u2019s fist was proverbial, and few of those present
    had not\r\nfelt the force of it in times past.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow \u2018tis my
    turn,\u201D said his antagonist coolly, casting aside his\r\ngauntlet. And with
    one blow of his fist the knight sent the friar\r\nspinning to the ground.\r\n\r\nIf
    there had been uproar and shouting before, it was as naught to the\r\nnoise which
    now broke forth. Every fellow held his sides or rolled upon\r\nthe ground from
    laughter; every fellow, save one, and that was Robin\r\nHood.\r\n\r\n\u201COut
    of the frying-pan into the fire!\u201D thought he. \u201CI wish I had let the\r\nfriar
    box my ears, after all!\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin\u2019s plight did, indeed, seem a
    sorry one, before the steel muscles\r\nof his stranger. But he was saved from
    a tumble heels over head by\r\nan unlooked-for diversion. A horn winded in the
    glade, and a party of\r\nknights were seen approaching.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo your
    arms!\u201D cried Robin, hurriedly seizing his sword and bow.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis
    Sir Richard of the Lea!\u201D cried another, as the troop came nearer.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so it was. Sir Richard spurred forward his horse and dashed up to\r\nthe camp
    while the outlaws stood at stiff attention. When he had come\r\nnear the spot
    where the Black Knight stood, he dismounted and knelt\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    trust Your Majesty has not needed our arms before,\u201D he said humbly.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is the King!\u201D cried Will Scarlet, falling upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    King!\u201D echoed Robin Hood after a moment of dumb wonderment; and he\r\nand
    all his men bent reverently upon their knees, as one man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XXIII\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARIAN WERE WED\r\n\r\n     \u201CStand
    up again,\u201D then said the King,\r\n     \u201CI\u2019ll thee thy pardon give;\r\n    
    Stand up, my friend, who can contend,\r\n     When I give leave to live?\u201D\r\n\r\n    
    Then Robin Hood began a health\r\n     To Marian, his only dear,\r\n     And
    his yeomen all, both comely and tall,\r\n     Did quickly bring up the rear.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour
    pardon, sire!\u201D exclaimed Robin Hood. \u201CPardon, from your royal\r\nbounty,
    for these my men who stand ready to serve you all your days!\u201D\r\n\r\nRichard
    of the Lion Heart looked grimly about over the kneeling band.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    it as your leader says?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, my lord King!\u201D
    burst from sevenscore throats at once.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe be not outlaws from choice
    alone,\u201D continued Robin; \u201Cbut have\r\nbeen driven to outlawry through
    oppression. Grant us grace and royal\r\nprotection, and we will forsake the greenwood
    and follow the King.\u201D\r\n\r\nRichard\u2019s eyes sparkled as he looked from
    one to another of this\r\nstalwart band, and he thought within himself that here,
    indeed, was a\r\nroyal bodyguard worth the while.\r\n\r\n\u201CSwear!\u201D he
    said in his full rich voice; \u201Cswear that you, Robin Hood,\r\nand all your
    men from this day henceforth will serve the King!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe swear!\u201D
    came once more the answering shout from the yeomen.\r\n\r\n\u201CArise, then,\u201D
    said King Richard. \u201CI give you all free pardon, and will\r\nspeedily put
    your service to the test. For I love such archers as you\r\nhave shown yourselves
    to be, and it were a sad pity to decree such men\r\nto death. England could not
    produce the like again, for many a day. But,\r\nin sooth, I cannot allow you
    to roam in the forest and shoot my deer;\r\nnor to take the law of the land into
    your own hands. Therefore, I now\r\nappoint you to be Royal Archers and mine
    own especial body-guard. There\r\nbe one or two civil matters to settle with
    certain Norman noblemen,\r\nin which I crave your aid. Thereafter, the half of
    your number, as\r\nmay later be determined, shall come back to these woodlands
    as Royal\r\nForesters. Mayhap you will show as much zeal in protecting my preserves\r\nas
    you have formerly shown in hunting them. Where, now, is that outlaw\r\nknown
    as Little John? Stand forth!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHere, sire,\u201D quoth the giant,
    doffing his cap.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood master Little John,\u201D said the King, looking
    him over approvingly.\r\n\u201CCould your weak sinews stand the strain of an
    office in the shire? If\r\nso, you are this day Sheriff of Nottingham; and I
    trust you will make a\r\nbetter official than the man you relieve.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    shall do my best, sire,\u201D said Little John, great astonishment and\r\ngladness
    in his heart.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaster Scarlet, stand forth,\u201D said the King;
    and then addressing him:\r\n\u201CI have heard somewhat of your tale,\u201D quoth
    he, \u201Cand that your father\r\nwas the friend of my father. Now, therefore,
    accept the royal pardon and\r\nresume the care of your family estates; for your
    father must be growing\r\nold. And come you to London next Court day and we shall
    see if there be\r\na knighthood vacant.\u201D\r\n\r\nLikewise the King called
    for Will Stutely and made him Chief of the\r\nRoyal Archers. Then he summoned
    Friar Tuck to draw near.\r\n\r\n\u201CI crave my King\u2019s pardon,\u201D said
    the priest, humbly enough; \u201Cfor who am\r\nI to lift my hand against the
    Lord\u2019s anointed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, the Lord sent the smiter to thee
    without delay,\u201D returned Richard\r\nsmiling; \u201Cand \u2018tis not for
    me to continue a quarrel between church and\r\nstate. So what can I do for you
    in payment of last night\u2019s hospitality?\r\nCan I find some fat living where
    there are no wicked to chastise, and\r\nwhere the work is easy and comfortable?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot
    so, my lord,\u201D replied Tuck. \u201CI wish only for peace in this life.\r\nMine
    is a simple nature and I care not for the fripperies and follies\r\nof court
    life. Give me a good meal and a cup of right brew, health, and\r\nenough for
    the day, and I ask no more.\u201D\r\n\r\nRichard sighed. \u201CYou ask the greatest
    thing in the world,\r\nbrother--contentment. It is not mine to give or to deny.
    But ask your\r\nGod for it, an if belike he grant it, then ask it also in behalf
    of your\r\nKing.\u201D He glanced around once more at the foresters. \u201CWhich
    one of you\r\nis Allan-a-Dale?\u201D he asked; and Allan came forward. \u201CSo,\u201D
    said the King\r\nwith sober face, \u201Cyou are that errant minstrel who stole
    a bride at\r\nPlympton, despite her would-be groom and attending Bishop. I heard\r\nsomething
    of this in former days. Now what excuse have you to make?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly
    that I loved her, sire, and she loved me,\u201D said Allan, simply;\r\n\u201Cand
    the Norman lord would have married her perforce, because of her\r\nlands.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich
    have since been forfeited by the Bishop of Hereford,\u201D added\r\nRichard.
    \u201CBut my lord Bishop must disgorge them; and from tomorrow you\r\nand Mistress
    Dale are to return to them and live in peace and loyalty.\r\nAnd if ever I need
    your harp at Court, stand ready to attend me, and\r\nbring also the lady. Speaking
    of ladies,\u201D he continued, turning to Robin\r\nHood, who had stood silent,
    wondering if a special punishment was\r\nbeing reserved for him, \u201Cdid you
    not have a sweetheart who was once at\r\nCourt--one, Mistress Marian? What has
    become of her, that you should\r\nhave forgotten her?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    Your Majesty,\u201D said the black-eyed page coming forward blushingly;\r\n\u201CRobin
    has not forgotten me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo!\u201D said the King, bending to
    kiss her small hand in all gallantry.\r\n\u201CVerily, as I have already thought
    within myself, this Master Hood is\r\nbetter served than the King in his palace!
    But are you not the only\r\nchild of the late Earl of Huntingdon?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am, sire, though there be some who say that Robin Hood\u2019s father\r\nwas formerly
    the rightful Earl of Huntingdon. Nathless, neither he is\r\nadvantaged nor I,
    for the estates are confiscate.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen they shall be restored
    forthwith!\u201D cried the King; \u201Cand lest you\r\ntwo should revive the
    ancient quarrel over them, I bestow them upon you\r\njointly. Come forward, Robin
    Hood.\u201D\r\n\r\nRobin came and knelt before his king. Richard drew his sword
    and touched\r\nhim upon the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201CRise, Robin Fitzooth, Earl
    of Huntingdon!\u201D he exclaimed, while a mighty\r\ncheer arose from the band
    and rent the air of the forest. \u201CThe first\r\ncommand I give you, my lord
    Earl,\u201D continued the King when quiet was\r\nrestored, \u201Cis to marry
    Mistress Marian without delay.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMay I obey all Your Majesty\u2019s
    commands as willingly!\u201D cried the new\r\nEarl of Huntingdon, drawing the
    old Earl\u2019s daughter close to him. \u201CThe\r\nceremony shall take place
    to-morrow, an this maid is willing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe makes little protest,\u201D
    said the King; \u201Cso I shall e\u2019en give away\r\nthe bride myself!\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    the King chatted with others of the foresters, and made himself as\r\none of
    them for the evening, rejoicing that he could have this careless\r\nfreedom of
    the woods. And Much, the miller\u2019s son, and Arthur-a-Bland,\r\nand Middle,
    and Stutely and Scarlet and Little John and others played\r\nat the quarter-staff,
    giving and getting many lusty blows. Then as\r\nthe shades of night drew on,
    the whole company--knights and\r\nforesters--supped and drank around a blazing
    fire, while Allen sang\r\nsweetly to the thrumming of the harp, and the others
    joined in the\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\n\u2018Twas a happy, care-free night--this last
    one together under the\r\ngreenwood tree. Robin could not help feeling an undertone
    of sadness\r\nthat it was to be the last; for the charm of the woodland was still
    upon\r\nhim. But he knew \u2018twas better so, and that the new life with Marian
    and\r\nin the service of his King would bring its own joys.\r\n\r\nThen the night
    deepened, the fire sank, but was replenished and the\r\ncompany lay down to rest.
    The King, at his own request, spent the night\r\nin the open. Thus they slept--King
    and subject alike--out under the\r\nstars, cared for lovingly by Nature, kind
    mother of us all.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the company was early astir and on their
    way to\r\nNottingham. It was a goodly cavalcade. First rode King Richard of the\r\nLion
    Heart, with his tall figure set forth by the black armor and waving\r\nplume
    in his helm. Then came Sir Richard of the Lea with fourscore\r\nknights and men-at-arms.
    And after them came Robin Hood and Maid Marian\r\nriding upon milk-white steeds.
    Allan-a-Dale also escorted Mistress Dale\r\non horseback, for she was to be matron-of-honor
    at the wedding. These\r\nwere followed by sevenscore archers clad in their bravest
    Lincoln green,\r\nand with their new bows unstrung in token of peace.\r\n\r\nOutside
    the gates of Nottingham town they were halted.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho comes here?\u201D
    asked the warder\u2019s surly voice.\r\n\r\n\u201COpen to the King of England!\u201D
    came back the clear answer, and the gates\r\nwere opened and the bridge let down
    without delay.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the company had crossed the moat the news
    spread through\r\nthe town like wildfire.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe King is here! The
    King is here, and hath taken Robin Hood!\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom every corner flocked
    the people to see the company pass; and wildly\r\ndid they cheer for the King,
    who rode smilingly with bared head down\r\nthrough the market-place.\r\n\r\nAt
    the far end of it, he was met by the Sheriff who came up puffing in\r\nhis haste
    to do the King honor. He fairly turned green with rage when he\r\nsaw Sir Richard
    of the Lea and Robin Hood in the royal company, but made\r\nlow obeisance to
    his master.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir Sheriff,\u201D quoth the King, \u201CI have come
    to rid the shire of outlaws,\r\naccording to my promise. There be none left,
    for all have now taken\r\nservice with their King. And lest there should be further
    outbreak,\r\nI have determined to place in charge of this shire a man who fears\r\nno
    other man in it. Master Little John is hereby created Sheriff of\r\nNottingham,
    and you will turn over the keys to him forthwith.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff bowed,
    but dared utter no word. Then the King turned to the\r\nBishop of Hereford, who
    had also come up to pay his respects.\r\n\r\n\u201CHarkee, my lord Bishop,\u201D
    quoth he, \u201Cthe stench of your evil actions\r\nhad reached our nostrils.
    We shall demand strict accounting for certain\r\nseizures of the lands and certain
    acts of oppression which ill become a\r\nchurchman. But of this later. This afternoon
    you must officiate at the\r\nwedding of two of our company, in Nottingham Church.
    So make you ready.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Bishop also bowed and departed, glad to escape
    a severer censure for\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThe company then rode on to the Mansion
    House, where the King held high\r\nlevee through all the noon hours, and the
    whole town made a holiday.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the way from the Mansion House
    to Nottingham Church was\r\nlined with cheering people, as the wedding party
    passed by. The famous\r\nbowmen were gazed at as curiously as though they had
    been wild animals,\r\nbut were cheered none the less. Robin who had long been
    held in secret\r\nliking was now doubly popular since he had the King\u2019s
    favor.\r\n\r\nAlong the way ahead of the King and the smiling bride and groom
    to be\r\nran little maids strewing flowers; while streamers floated in greeting\r\nfrom
    the windows. I ween, the only hearts that were not glad this day\r\nwere those
    of the old Sheriff, and of his proud daughter, who peered\r\nbetween the shutters
    of her window and was like to eat out her heart\r\nfrom envy and hatred.\r\n\r\nAt
    last the party reached the church, where the King dismounted lightly\r\nfrom
    his horse and helped the bride to alight; while Will Scarlet,\r\nthe best man,
    assisted Mistress Dale. Within the church they found\r\nthe Bishop robed in state,
    and by his side Friar Tuck who had been\r\nespecially deputed to assist.\r\n\r\nThe
    service was said in Latin, while the organ pealed forth softly. The\r\nKing gave
    away the bride, as he had said, and afterwards claimed first\r\nkiss for his
    pains. Then the happy party dispersed, and Robin and Marian\r\npassed out again
    through the portal, man and wife.\r\n\r\nOut through the cheering streets they
    fared, while the greenwood men ran\r\nahead and flung gold pennies right and
    left in their joy, and bade the\r\npeople drink the health of the young couple
    and the King. Then the\r\nwhole party took horse at Will Scarlet\u2019s earnest
    wish, and went down to\r\nGamewell Lodge, where the old Squire George wept for
    joy at seeing his\r\nson and the King and the wedding--party. That night they
    spent there,\r\nand feasted, and the next day, Sir Richard of the Lea claimed
    them.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, amid feasting and rejoicing and kingly favor, Robin Hood,
    the\r\nnew Earl of Huntingdon, and his bride began their wedded life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XXIV\r\n\r\nHOW ROBIN HOOD MET HIS DEATH\r\n\r\n     \u201CGive me my bent bow
    in my hand,\r\n     And a broad arrow I\u2019ll let flee;\r\n     And where this
    arrow is taken up,\r\n     There shall my grave digg\u2019d be.\u201D\r\n\r\nNow
    by good rights this story should end with the wedding of Robin Hood\r\nand Maid
    Marian; for do not many pleasant tales end with a wedding and\r\nthe saying,
    \u201Cand they lived happy ever after.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut this is a true account--in
    so far as we can find the quaint old\r\nballads which tell of it--and so we must
    follow one more of these songs\r\nand learn how Robin, after living many years
    longer, at last came to\r\nseek his grave. And the story of it runs in this wise.\r\n\r\nRobin
    Hood and his men, now the Royal Archers, went with King Richard of\r\nthe Lion
    Heart through England settling certain private disputes which\r\nhad arisen among
    the Norman barons while the King was gone to the Holy\r\nLand. Then the King
    proceeded amid great pomp and rejoicing to the\r\npalace at London, and Robin,
    the new Earl of Huntingdon, brought his\r\nCountess thither, where she became
    one of the finest ladies of the\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Archers were now divided
    into two bands, and one-half of them\r\nwere retained in London, while the other
    half returned to Sherwood and\r\nBarnesdale, there to guard the King\u2019s preserves.\r\n\r\nSeveral
    months passed by, and Robin began to chafe under the restraint\r\nof city life.
    He longed for the fresh pure air of the greenwood, and\r\nthe rollicking society
    of his yeomen. One day, upon seeing some lads\r\nat archery practice upon a green,
    he could not help but lament, saying,\r\n\u201CWoe is me! I fear my hand is fast
    losing its old time cunning at the\r\nbow-string!\u201D\r\n\r\nFinally he became
    so distraught that he asked leave to travel in foreign\r\nlands, and this was
    granted him. He took Maid Marian with him, and\r\ntogether they went through
    many strange countries. Finally in an Eastern\r\nland a great grief came upon
    Robin. Marian sickened of a plague and\r\ndied. They had been married but five
    years, and Robin felt as though all\r\nthe light had gone out of his life.\r\n\r\nHe
    wandered about the world for a few months longer, trying to forget\r\nhis grief,
    then came back to the court, at London, and sought some\r\ncommission in active
    service. But unluckily, Richard was gone again upon\r\nhis adventures, and Prince
    John, who acted as Regent, had never been\r\nfond of Robin. He received him with
    a sarcastic smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo forth into the greenwood,\u201D said he, coldly,
    \u201Cand kill some more of\r\nthe King\u2019s deer. Belike, then, the King will
    make you Prime Minister, at\r\nthe very least, upon his return.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    taunt fired Robin\u2019s blood. He had been in a morose mood, ever since\r\nhis
    dear wife\u2019s death. He answered Prince John hotly, and the Prince\r\nbade
    his guards seize him and cast him into the Tower.\r\n\r\nAfter lying there for
    a few weeks, he was released by the faithful\r\nStutely and the remnant of the
    Royal Archers, and all together they fled\r\nthe city and made their way to the
    greenwood. There Robin blew the old\r\nfamiliar call, which all had known and
    loved so well. Up came running\r\nthe remainder of the band, who had been Royal
    Foresters, and when they\r\nsaw their old master they embraced his knees and
    kissed his hands, and\r\nfairly cried for joy that he had come again to them.
    And one and all\r\nforswore fealty to Prince John, and lived quietly with Robin
    in the\r\ngreenwood, doing harm to none and only awaiting the time when King\r\nRichard
    should come again.\r\n\r\nBut King Richard came not again, and would never need
    his Royal Guard\r\nmore. Tidings presently reached them, of how he had met his
    death in a\r\nforeign land, and how John reigned as King in his stead. The proof
    of\r\nthese events followed soon after, when there came striding through the\r\nglade
    the big, familiar form of Little John.\r\n\r\n\u201CArt come to arrest us?\u201D
    called out Robin, as he ran forward and\r\nembraced his old comrade.\r\n\r\n\u201CNay,
    I am not come as the Sheriff of Nottingham, thanks be,\u201D answered\r\nLittle
    John. \u201CThe new King has deposed me, and \u2018tis greatly to\r\nmy liking,
    for I have long desired to join you here again in the\r\ngreenwood.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    were the rest of the band right glad at this news, and toasted\r\nLittle John
    royally.\r\n\r\nThe new King waged fierce war upon the outlaws, soon after this,
    and\r\nsent so many scouting parties into Sherwood and Barnesdale that Robin\r\nand
    his men left these woods for a time and went into Derbyshire, near\r\nHaddon
    Hall. A curious pile of stone is shown to this day as the ruins\r\nof Robin\u2019s
    Castle, where the bold outlaw is believed to have defied his\r\nenemies for a
    year or more. At any rate King John found so many troubles\r\nof his own, after
    a time, that he ceased troubling the outlaws.\r\n\r\nBut in one of the last sorties
    Robin was wounded. The cut did not seem\r\nserious, and healed over the top;
    but it left a lurking fever. Daily his\r\nstrength ebbed away from him, until
    he was in sore distress.\r\n\r\nOne day as he rode along on horseback, near Kirklees
    Abbey, he was\r\nseized with so violent a rush of blood to the head that he reeled
    and\r\ncame near falling from his saddle. He dismounted weakly and knocked at\r\nthe
    Abbey gate. A woman shrouded in black peered forth.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you
    that knock here? For we allow no man within these walls,\u201D\r\n she said.\r\n\r\n\u201COpen,
    for the love of Heaven!\u201D he begged. \u201CI am Robin Hood, ill of a\r\nfever
    and in sore straits.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt the name of Robin Hood the woman started
    back, and then, as though\r\nbethinking herself, unbarred the door and admitted
    him. Assisting his\r\nfainting frame up a flight of stairs and into a front room,
    she loosed\r\nhis collar and bathed his face until he was revived. Then she spoke\r\nhurriedly
    in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CYour fever will sink, if you are bled. See, I have
    provided a lancet\r\nand will open your veins, while you lie quiet.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    she bled him, and he fell into a stupor which lasted nearly all that\r\nday,
    so that he awoke weak and exhausted from loss of blood.\r\n\r\nNow there is a
    dispute as to this abbess who bled him. Some say that\r\nshe did it in all kindness
    of heart; while others aver that she was none\r\nother than the former Sheriff\u2019s
    daughter, and found her revenge at last\r\nin this cruel deed.\r\n\r\nBe that
    as it may, Robin\u2019s eyes swam from very weakness when he awoke.\r\n\r\nHe
    called wearily for help, but there was no response. He looked\r\nlongingly through
    the window at the green of the forest; but he was too\r\nweak to make the leap
    that would be needed to reach the ground.\r\n\r\n     He then bethought him of
    his horn,\r\n     Which hung down at his knee;\r\n     He set his horn unto his
    mouth,\r\n     And blew out weak blasts three.\r\n\r\nLittle John was out in
    the forest near by, or the blasts would never\r\nhave been heard. At their sound
    he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoe! woe!\u201D he cried, \u201CI fear my
    master is near dead, he blows so\r\nwearily!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo he made haste and
    came running up to the door of the abbey, and\r\nknocked loudly for admittance.
    Failing to get reply, he burst in the\r\ndoor with frenzied blows of his mighty
    fist, and soon came running up\r\nto the room where Robin lay, white and faint.
    \u201CAlas, dear master!\u201D cried\r\nLittle John in great distress; \u201CI
    fear you have met with treachery! If\r\nthat be so, grant me one last boon, I
    pray.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D asked Robin.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me burn
    Kirklees-Hall with fire, and all its nunnery.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNay, good comrade,\u201D
    answered Robin Hood gently, \u201CI cannot grant such\r\na boon. The dear Christ
    bade us forgive all our enemies. Moreover,\r\nyou know I never hurt woman in
    all my life; nor man when in woman\u2019s\r\ncompany.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe closed
    his eyes and fell back, so that his friend thought him dying.\r\nThe great tears
    fell from the giant\u2019s eyes and wet his master\u2019s hand.\r\nRobin slowly
    rallied and seized his comrade\u2019s outstretched arm.\r\n\r\n\u201CLift me
    up, good Little John,\u201D he said brokenly, \u201CI want to smell\r\nthe air
    from the good greenwood once again. Give me my good yew\r\nbow--here--here-and
    fix a broad arrow upon the string. Out yonder--among\r\nthe oaks--where this
    arrow shall fall--let them dig my grave.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd with one last mighty
    effort he sped his shaft out of the open\r\nwindow, straight and true, as in
    the days of old, till it struck the\r\nlargest oak of them all and dropped in
    the shadow of the trees. Then he\r\nfell back upon the sobbing breast of his
    devoted friend.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2018Tis the last!\u201D he murmured, \u201Ctell
    the brave hearts to lay me there\r\nwith the green sod under my head and feet.
    And--let them lay--my bent\r\nbow at my side, for it has made sweet music in
    mine ears.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe rested a moment, and Little John scarce knew that
    he was alive. But\r\non a sudden Robin\u2019s eye brightened, and he seemed to
    think himself back\r\nonce more with the band in the open forest glade. He struggled
    to rise.\r\n\r\n\u201CHa! \u2018tis a fine stag, Will! And Allan, thou never
    didst thrum the harp\r\nmore sweetly. How the light blazes! And Marian!--\u2018tis
    my Marian--come at\r\nlast!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo died the body of Robin Hood; but
    his spirit lives on through the\r\ncenturies in the deathless ballads which are
    sung of him, and in the\r\nhearts of men who love freedom and chivalry.\r\n\r\nThey
    buried him where his last arrow had fallen, and they set a stone to\r\nmark the
    spot. And on the stone were graven these words:\r\n\r\n     \u201CHere underneath
    his little stone\r\n     Lies Robert, Earl of Huntingdon;\r\n     Never archer
    as he so good,\r\n     And people called him Robin Hood.\r\n     Such outlaws
    as he and his men\r\n     Will England never see again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd

    Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works
    in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete,
    old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds
    of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers
    and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need,
    is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that
    the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations
    to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created
    to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
    generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand
    how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation
    web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the
    Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg
    Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation

    Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends
    upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to
    carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed
    works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by
    the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1
    to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with
    the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities
    and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance
    requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork
    and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit
    donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of
    compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular
    state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions
    from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of
    no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such
    states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations
    are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax
    treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws
    alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages
    for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number
    of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo
    donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General
    Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor
    Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a
    library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For
    thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with
    only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks
    are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed
    as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus,
    we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
    edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
    facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes
    information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to
    the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our
    new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new
    eBooks.\r\n"

    the centre of the pine wood called Coilla Doraca there lived not long\r\nago
    two Philosophers. They were wiser than anything else in the world\r\nexcept the
    Salmon who lies in the pool of Glyn Cagny into which the nuts\r\nof knowledge
    fall from the hazel bush on its bank. He, of course, is the\r\nmost profound
    of living creatures, but the two Philosophers are next to\r\nhim in wisdom. Their
    faces looked as though they were made of parchment,\r\nthere was ink under their
    nails, and every difficulty that was submitted\r\nto them, even by women, they
    were able to instantly resolve. The Grey\r\nWoman of Dun Gortin and the Thin
    Woman of Inis Magrath asked them the\r\nthree questions which nobody had ever
    been able to answer, and they were\r\nable to answer them. That was how they
    obtained the enmity of these two\r\nwomen which is more valuable than the friendship
    of angels. The Grey\r\nWoman and the Thin Woman were so incensed at being answered
    that they\r\nmarried the two Philosophers in order to be able to pinch them in
    bed,\r\nbut the skins of the Philosophers were so thick that they did not know\r\nthey
    were being pinched. They repaid the fury of the women with such\r\ntender affection
    that these vicious creatures almost expired of chagrin,\r\nand once, in a very
    ecstacy of exasperation, after having been kissed\r\nby their husbands, they
    uttered the fourteen hundred maledictions which\r\ncomprised their wisdom, and
    these were learned by the Philosophers who\r\nthus became even wiser than before.\r\n\r\nIn
    due process of time two children were born of these marriages. They\r\nwere born
    on the same day and in the same hour, and they were only\r\ndifferent in this,
    that one of them was a boy and the other one was a\r\ngirl. Nobody was able to
    tell how this had happened, and, for the first\r\ntime in their lives, the Philosophers
    were forced to admire an event\r\nwhich they had been unable to prognosticate;
    but having proved by many\r\ndifferent methods that the children were really
    children, that what\r\nmust be must be, that a fact cannot be controverted, and
    that what\r\nhas happened once may happen twice, they described the occurrence\r\nas
    extraordinary but not unnatural, and submitted peacefully to a\r\nProvidence
    even wiser than they were.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher who had the boy was very pleased
    because, he said, there\r\nwere too many women in the world, and the Philosopher
    who had the girl\r\nwas very pleased also because, he said, you cannot have too
    much of a\r\ngood thing: the Grey Woman and the Thin Woman, however, were not
    in the\r\nleast softened by maternity-they said that they had not bargained for\r\nit,
    that the children were gotten under false presences, that they were\r\nrespectable
    married women, and that, as a protest against their wrongs,\r\nthey would not
    cook any more food for the Philosophers. This was\r\npleasant news for their
    husbands, who disliked the women\u2019s cooking\r\nvery much, but they did not
    say so, for the women would certainly\r\nhave insisted on their rights to cook
    had they imagined their husbands\r\ndisliked the results: therefore, the Philosophers
    besought their wives\r\nevery day to cook one of their lovely dinners again,
    and this the women\r\nalways refused to do.\r\n\r\nThey all lived together in
    a small house in the very centre of a dark\r\npine wood. Into this place the
    sun never shone because the shade was too\r\ndeep, and no wind ever came there
    either, because the boughs were too\r\nthick, so that it was the most solitary
    and quiet place in the world,\r\nand the Philosophers were able to hear each
    other thinking all day long,\r\nor making speeches to each other, and these were
    the pleasantest\r\nsounds they knew of. To them there were only two kinds of
    sounds\r\nanywhere--these were conversation and noise: they liked the first very\r\nmuch
    indeed, but they spoke of the second with stern disapproval, and,\r\neven when
    it was made by a bird, a breeze, or a shower of rain, they\r\ngrew angry and
    demanded that it should be abolished. Their wives seldom\r\nspoke at all and
    yet they were never silent: they communicated with each\r\nother by a kind of
    physical telegraphy which they had learned among the\r\nShee-they cracked their
    finger-joints quickly or slowly and so were able\r\nto communicate with each
    other over immense distances, for by dint of\r\nlong practice they could make
    great explosive sounds which were nearly\r\nlike thunder, and gentler sounds
    like the tapping of grey ashes on a\r\nhearthstone. The Thin Woman hated her
    own child, but she loved the Grey\r\nWoman\u2019s baby, and the Grey Woman loved
    the Thin Woman\u2019s infant but could\r\nnot abide her own. A compromise may
    put an end to the most perplexing\r\nof situations, and, consequently, the two
    women swapped children, and\r\nat once became the most tender and amiable mothers
    imaginable, and the\r\nfamilies were able to live together in a more perfect
    amity than could\r\nbe found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe children grew in grace
    and comeliness. At first the little boy was\r\nshort and fat and the little girl
    was long and thin, then the little\r\ngirl became round and chubby while the
    little boy grew lanky and wiry.\r\nThis was because the little girl used to sit
    very quiet and be good and\r\nthe little boy used not.\r\n\r\nThey lived for
    many years in the deep seclusion of the pine wood wherein\r\na perpetual twilight
    reigned, and here they were wont to play their\r\nchildish games, flitting among
    the shadowy trees like little quick\r\nshadows. At times their mothers, the Grey
    Woman and the Thin Woman,\r\nplayed with them, but this was seldom, and sometimes
    their fathers, the\r\ntwo Philosophers, came out and looked at them through spectacles
    which\r\nwere very round and very glassy, and had immense circles of horn all\r\nround
    the edges. They had, however, other playmates with whom they could\r\nromp all
    day long. There were hundreds of rabbits running about in the\r\nbrushwood; they
    were full of fun and were very fond of playing with the\r\nchildren. There were
    squirrels who joined cheerfully in their games, and\r\nsome goats, having one
    day strayed in from the big world, were made so\r\nwelcome that they always came
    again whenever they got the chance. There\r\nwere birds also, crows and blackbirds
    and willy-wagtails, who were well\r\nacquainted with the youngsters, and visited
    them as frequently as their\r\nbusy lives permitted.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance
    from their home there was a clearing in the wood\r\nabout ten feet square; through
    this clearing, as through a funnel, the\r\nsun for a few hours in the summer
    time blazed down. It was the boy who\r\nfirst discovered the strange radiant
    shaft in the wood. One day he had\r\nbeen sent out to collect pine cones for
    the fire. As these were gathered\r\ndaily the supply immediately near the house
    was scanty, therefore he\r\nhad, while searching for more, wandered further from
    his home than\r\nusual. The first sight of the extraordinary blaze astonished
    him. He\r\nhad never seen anything like it before, and the steady, unwinking
    glare\r\naroused his fear and curiosity equally. Curiosity will conquer fear\r\neven
    more than bravery will; indeed, it has led many people into dangers\r\nwhich
    mere physical courage would shudder away from, for hunger and love\r\nand curiosity
    are the great impelling forces of life. When the little\r\nboy found that the
    light did not move he drew closer to it, and at last,\r\nemboldened by curiosity,
    he stepped right into it and found that it was\r\nnot a thing at all. The instant
    that he stepped into the light he found\r\nit was hot, and this so frightened
    him that he jumped out of it again\r\nand ran behind a tree. Then he jumped into
    it for a moment and out of it\r\nagain, and for nearly half an hour he played
    a splendid game of tip and\r\ntig with the sunlight. At last he grew quite bold
    and stood in it and\r\nfound that it did not burn him at all, but he did not
    like to remain\r\nin it, fearing that he might be cooked. When he went home with
    the pine\r\ncones he said nothing to the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin or to the Thin\r\nWoman
    of Inis Magrath or to the two Philosophers, but he told the little\r\ngirl all
    about it when they went to bed, and every day afterwards they\r\nused to go and
    play with the sunlight, and the rabbits and the squirrels\r\nwould follow them
    there and join in their games with twice the interest\r\nthey had shown before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    II\r\n\r\nTo the lonely house in the pine wood people sometimes came for advice\r\non
    subjects too recondite for even those extremes of elucidation, the\r\nparish
    priest and the tavern. These people were always well received,\r\nand their perplexities
    were attended to instantly, for the Philosophers\r\nliked being wise and they
    were not ashamed to put their learning to\r\nthe proof, nor were they, as so
    many wise people are, fearful lest they\r\nshould become poor or less respected
    by giving away their knowledge.\r\nThese were favourite maxims with them:\r\n\r\nYou
    must be fit to give before you can be fit to receive.\r\n\r\nKnowledge becomes
    lumber in a week, therefore, get rid of it.\r\n\r\nThe box must be emptied before
    it can be refilled.\r\n\r\nRefilling is progress.\r\n\r\nA sword, a spade, and
    a thought should never be allowed to rust.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Woman and the Thin
    Woman, however, held opinions quite contrary\r\nto these, and their maxims also
    were different:\r\n\r\nA secret is a weapon and a friend.\r\n\r\nMan is God\u2019s
    secret, Power is man\u2019s secret, Sex is woman\u2019s secret.\r\n\r\nBy having
    much you are fitted to have more.\r\n\r\nThere is always room in the box.\r\n\r\nThe
    art of packing is the last lecture of wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe scalp of your enemy
    is progress.\r\n\r\nHolding these opposed views it seemed likely that visitors
    seeking for\r\nadvice from the Philosophers might be astonished and captured
    by their\r\nwives; but the women were true to their own doctrines and refused
    to\r\npart with information to any persons saving only those of high rank,\r\nsuch
    as policemen, gombeen men, and district and county councillors;\r\nbut even to
    these they charged high prices for their information, and a\r\nbonus on any gains
    which accrued through the following of their advices.\r\nIt is unnecessary to
    state that their following was small when compared\r\nwith those who sought the
    assistance of their husbands, for scarcely a\r\nweek passed but some person came
    through the pine wood with his brows in\r\na tangle of perplexity.\r\n\r\nIn
    these people the children were deeply interested. They used to go\r\napart afterwards
    and talk about them, and would try to remember what\r\nthey looked like, how
    they talked, and their manner of walking or taking\r\nsnuff. After a time they
    became interested in the problems which these\r\npeople submitted to their parents
    and the replies or instructions\r\nwherewith the latter relieved them. Long training
    had made the\r\nchildren able to sit perfectly quiet, so that when the talk came
    to the\r\ninteresting part they were entirely forgotten, and ideas which might\r\notherwise
    have been spared their youth became the commonplaces of their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the children were ten years of age one of the Philosophers died. He\r\ncalled
    the household together and announced that the time had come when\r\nhe must bid
    them all good-bye, and that his intention was to die as\r\nquickly as might be.
    It was, he continued, an unfortunate thing that his\r\nhealth was at the moment
    more robust than it had been for a long time,\r\nbut that, of course, was no
    obstacle to his resolution, for death did\r\nnot depend upon ill-health but upon
    a multitude of other factors with\r\nthe details whereof he would not trouble
    them.\r\n\r\nHis wife, the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin, applauded this resolution
    and\r\nadded as an amendment that it was high time he did something, that the\r\nlife
    he had been leading was an arid and unprofitable one, that he had\r\nstolen her
    fourteen hundred maledictions for which he had no use and\r\npresented her with
    a child for which she had none, and that, all things\r\nconcerned, the sooner
    he did die and stop talking the sooner everybody\r\nconcerned would be made happy.\r\n\r\nThe
    other Philosopher replied mildly as he lit his pipe: \u201CBrother,\r\nthe greatest
    of all virtues is curiosity, and the end of all desire\r\nis wisdom; tell us,
    therefore, by what steps you have arrived at this\r\ncommendable resolution.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo
    this the Philosopher replied: \u201CI have attained to all the wisdom\r\nwhich
    I am fitted to bear. In the space of one week no new truth has\r\ncome to me.
    All that I have read lately I knew before; all that I have\r\nthought has been
    but a recapitulation of old and wearisome ideas. There\r\nis no longer an horizon
    before my eves. Space has narrowed to the petty\r\ndimensions of my thumb. Time
    is the tick of a clock. Good and evil are\r\ntwo peas in the one pod. My wife\u2019s
    face is the same for ever. I want to\r\nplay with the children, and yet I do
    not want to. Your conversation with\r\nme, brother, is like the droning of a
    bee in a dark cell. The pine trees\r\ntake root and grow and die.--It\u2019s
    all bosh. Good-bye.\u201D\r\n\r\nHis friend replied:\r\n\r\n\u201CBrother, these
    are weighty reflections, and I do clearly perceive that\r\nthe time has come
    for you to stop. I might observe, not in order to\r\ncombat your views, but merely
    to continue an interesting conversation,\r\nthat there are still some knowledges
    which you have not assimilated--you\r\ndo not yet know how to play the tambourine,
    nor how to be nice to your\r\nwife, nor how to get up first in the morning and
    cook the breakfast.\r\nHave you learned how to smoke strong tobacco as I do?
    or can you dance\r\nin the moonlight with a woman of the Shee? To understand
    the theory\r\nwhich underlies all things is not sufficient. It has occurred to
    me,\r\nbrother, that wisdom may not be the end of everything. Goodness and\r\nkindliness
    are, perhaps, beyond wisdom. Is it not possible that the\r\nultimate end is gaiety
    and music and a dance of joy? Wisdom is the\r\noldest of all things. Wisdom is
    all head and no heart. Behold, brother,\r\nyou are being crushed under the weight
    of your head. You are dying of\r\nold age while you are yet a child.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBrother,\u201D
    replied the other Philosopher, \u201Cyour voice is like the\r\ndroning of a bee
    in a dark cell. If in my latter days I am reduced to\r\nplaying on the tambourine
    and running after a hag in the moonlight, and\r\ncooking your breakfast in the
    grey morning, then it is indeed time that\r\nI should die. Good-bye, brother.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    saying, the Philosopher arose and removed all the furniture to the\r\nsides of
    the room so that there was a clear space left in the centre.\r\nHe then took
    off his boots and his coat, and standing on his toes he\r\ncommenced to gyrate
    with extraordinary rapidity. In a few moments his\r\nmovements became steady
    and swift, and a sound came from him like the\r\nhumming of a swift saw; this
    sound grew deeper and deeper, and at last\r\ncontinuous, so that the room was
    filled with a thrilling noise. In a\r\nquarter of an hour the movement began
    to noticeably slacken. In another\r\nthree minutes it was quite slow. In two
    more minutes he grew visible\r\nagain as a body, and then he wobbled to and fro,
    and at last dropped\r\nin a heap on the floor. He was quite dead, and on his
    face was an\r\nexpression of serene beatitude.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod be with you,
    brother,\u201D said the remaining Philosopher, and he lit\r\nhis pipe, focused
    his vision on the extreme tip of his nose, and began\r\nto meditate profoundly
    on the aphorism whether the good is the all or\r\nthe all is the good. In another
    moment he would have become oblivious of\r\nthe room, the company, and the corpse,
    but the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin\r\nshattered his meditation by a demand for
    advice as to what should next\r\nbe done. The Philosopher, with an effort, detached
    his eyes from his\r\nnose and his mind from his maxim.\r\n\r\n\u201CChaos,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cis the first condition. Order is the first law.\r\nContinuity
    is the first reflection. Quietude is the first happiness. Our\r\nbrother is dead--bury
    him.\u201D So saying, he returned his eyes to his nose,\r\nand his mind to his
    maxim, and lapsed to a profound reflection wherein\r\nnothing sat perched on
    insubstantiality, and the Spirit of Artifice\r\ngoggled at the puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe
    Grey Woman of Dun Gortin took a pinch of snuff from her box and\r\nraised the
    keen over her husband:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou were my husband and you are dead.\r\n\r\nIt
    is wisdom that has killed you.\r\n\r\nIf you had listened to my wisdom instead
    of to your own you would still\r\nbe a trouble to me and I would still be happy.\r\n\r\nWomen
    are stronger than men--they do not die of wisdom.\r\n\r\nThey are better than
    men because they do not seek wisdom.\r\n\r\nThey are wiser than men because they
    know less and understand more.\r\n\r\nI had fourteen hundred maledictions, my
    little store, and by a trick you\r\nstole them and left me empty.\r\n\r\nYou
    stole my wisdom and it has broken your neck.\r\n\r\nI lost my knowledge and I
    am yet alive raising the keen over your body,\r\nbut it was too heavy for you,
    my little knowledge.\r\n\r\nYou will never go out into the pine wood in the morning,
    or wander\r\nabroad on a night of stars.\r\n\r\nYou will not sit in the chimney-corner
    on the hard nights, or go to bed,\r\nor rise again, or do anything at all from
    this day out.\r\n\r\nWho will gather pine cones now when the fire is going down,
    or call my\r\nname in the empty house, or be angry when the kettle is not boiling?\r\n\r\nNow
    I am desolate indeed. I have no knowledge, I have no husband, I have\r\nno more
    to say.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I had anything better you should have it,\u201D
    said she politely to the\r\nThin Woman of Inis Magrath.\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D
    said the Thin Woman, \u201Cit was very nice. Shall I begin now?\r\nMy husband
    is meditating and we may be able to annoy him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    trouble yourself,\u201D replied the other, \u201CI am past enjoyment and\r\nam,
    moreover, a respectable woman.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is no more than the truth,
    indeed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have always done the right thing at the right time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d
    be the last body in the world to deny that,\u201D was the warm response.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery
    well, then,\u201D said the Grey Woman, and she commenced to take off\r\nher boots.
    She stood in the centre of the room and balanced herself on\r\nher toe.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    are a decent, respectable lady,\u201D said the Thin Woman of Inis\r\nMagrath,
    and then the Grey Woman began to gyrate rapidly and more\r\nrapidly until she
    was a very fervour of motion, and in three-quarters\r\nof an hour (for she was
    very tough) she began to slacken, grew visible,\r\nwobbled, and fell beside her
    dead husband, and on her face was a\r\nbeatitude almost surpassing his.\r\n\r\nThe
    Thin Woman of Inis Magrath smacked the children and put them to bed,\r\nnext
    she buried the two bodies under the hearthstone, and then, with\r\nsome trouble,
    detached her husband from his meditations. When he became\r\ncapable of ordinary
    occurrences she detailed all that had happened, and\r\nsaid that he alone was
    to blame for the sad bereavement. He replied:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe toxin generates
    the anti-toxin. The end lies concealed in the\r\nbeginning. All bodies grow around
    a skeleton. Life is a petticoat about\r\ndeath. I will not go to bed.\u201D\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    III\r\n\r\nON the day following this melancholy occurrence Meehawl MacMurrachu,\r\na
    small farmer in the neighbourhood, came through the pine trees with\r\ntangled
    brows. At the door of the little house he said, \u201CGod be with all\r\nhere,\u201D
    and marched in.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher removed his pipe from his lips-\u201CGod
    be with yourself,\u201D\r\n said he, and he replaced his pipe.\r\n\r\nMeehawl
    MacMurrachu crooked his thumb at space, \u201CWhere is the other one?\u201D\r\nsaid
    he.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh!\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe might be outside,
    maybe?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe might, indeed,\u201D said the Philosopher gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,
    it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D said the visitor, \u201Cfor you have enough\r\nknowledge
    by yourself to stock a shop. The reason I came here to-day was\r\nto ask your
    honoured advice about my wife\u2019s washing-board. She only has\r\nit a couple
    of years, and the last time she used it was when she washed\r\nout my Sunday
    shirt and her black skirt with the red things on it--you\r\nknow the one?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do not,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, anyhow, the washboard
    is gone, and my wife says it was either\r\ntaken by the fairies or by Bessie
    Hannigan--you know Bessie Hannigan?\r\nShe has whiskers like a goat and a lame
    leg!\u201D \u201CI do not,\u201D said the\r\nPhilosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo matter,\u201D
    said Meehawl MacMurrachu. \u201CShe didn\u2019t take it, because my\r\nwife got
    her out yesterday and kept her talking for two hours while\r\nI went through
    everything in her bit of a house--the washboard wasn\u2019t\r\nthere.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    wouldn\u2019t be,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe your honour
    could tell a body where it is then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe I could,\u201D said
    the Philosopher; \u201Care you listening?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am,\u201D said
    Meehawl MacMurrachu.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher drew his chair closer to the visitor
    until their knees\r\nwere jammed together. He laid both his hands on Meehawl
    MacMurrachu\u2019s\r\nknees \u201CWashing is an extraordinary custom,\u201D said
    he. \u201CWe are washed both\r\non coming into the world and on going out of
    it, and we take no pleasure\r\nfrom the first washing nor any profit from the
    last.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTrue for you, sir,\u201D said Meehawl MacMurrachu.\r\n\r\n\u201CMany
    people consider that scourings supplementary to these are only due\r\nto habit.
    Now, habit is continuity of action, it is a most detestable\r\nthing and is very
    difficult to get away from. A proverb will run where\r\na writ will not, and
    the follies of our forefathers are of greater\r\nimportance to us than is the
    well-being of our posterity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t say a word against
    that, sir,\u201D said Meehawl MacMurrachu.\r\n\r\n\u201CCats are a philosophic
    and thoughtful race, but they do not admit the\r\nefficacy of either water or
    soap, and yet it is usually conceded that\r\nthey are cleanly folk. There are
    exceptions to every rule, and I once\r\nknew a cat who lusted after water and
    bathed daily: he was an unnatural\r\nbrute and died ultimately of the head staggers.
    Children are nearly as\r\nwise as cats. It is true that they will utilize water
    in a variety of\r\nways, for instance, the destruction of a tablecloth or a pinafore,
    and I\r\nhave observed them greasing a ladder with soap, showing in the process
    a\r\ngreat knowledge of the properties of this material.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    shouldn\u2019t they, to be sure?\u201D said Meehawl MacMurrachu. \u201CHave you\r\ngot
    a match, sir?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CSparrows,
    again, are a highly acute\r\nand reasonable folk. They use water to quench thirst,
    but when they are\r\ndirty they take a dust bath and are at once cleansed. Of
    course, birds\r\nare often seen in the water, but they go there to catch fish
    and not to\r\nwash. I have often fancied that fish are a dirty, sly, and unintelligent\r\npeople--this
    is due to their staying so much in the water, and it has\r\nbeen observed that
    on being removed from this element they at once\r\nexpire through sheer ecstasy
    at escaping from their prolonged washing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have seen them
    doing it myself,\u201D said Meehawl. \u201CDid you ever hear,\r\nsir, about the
    fish that Paudeen MacLoughlin caught in the policeman\u2019s\r\nhat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    did not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CThe first person who washed was\r\npossibly
    a person seeking a cheap notoriety. Any fool can wash himself,\r\nbut every wise
    man knows that it is an unnecessary labour, for nature\r\nwill quickly reduce
    him to a natural and healthy dirtiness again. We\r\nshould seek, therefore, not
    how to make ourselves clean, but how to\r\nattain a more unique and splendid
    dirtiness, and perhaps the accumulated\r\nlayers of matter might, by ordinary
    geologic compulsion, become\r\nincorporated with the human cuticle and so render
    clothing\r\nunnecessary--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAbout that washboard,\u201D said
    Meehawl, \u201CI was just going to say--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D
    said the Philosopher. \u201CIn its proper place I admit\r\nthe necessity for
    water. As a thing to sail a ship on it can scarcely be\r\nsurpassed (not, you
    will understand, that I entirely approve of ships,\r\nthey tend to create and
    perpetuate international curiosity and the\r\nsmaller vermin of different latitudes).
    As an element wherewith to put\r\nout a fire, or brew tea, or make a slide in
    winter it is useful, but in\r\na tin basin it has a repulsive and meagre aspect.--Now
    as to your wife\u2019s\r\nwashboard--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood luck to your honour,\u201D
    said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour wife says that either the fairies or a woman
    with a goat\u2019s leg has\r\nit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s her whiskers,\u201D
    said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are lame,\u201D said the Philosopher sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave
    it your own way, sir, I\u2019m not certain now how the creature is\r\nafflicted.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    say that this unhealthy woman has not got your wife\u2019s washboard. It\r\nremains,
    therefore, that the fairies have it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt looks that way,\u201D
    said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are six clans of fairies living in this neighbourhood;
    but the\r\nprocess of elimination, which has shaped the world to a globe, the
    ant\r\nto its environment, and man to the captaincy of the vertebrates, will\r\nnot
    fail in this instance either.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you ever see anything like
    the way wasps have increased this\r\nseason?\u201D said Meehawl; \u201Cfaith,
    you can\u2019t sit down anywhere but your\r\nbreeches--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    did not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CDid you leave out a pan of milk on\r\nlast
    Tuesday?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you take off your
    hat when you meet a dust twirl?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t neglect that,\u201D
    said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you cut down a thorn bush recently?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d
    sooner cut my eye out,\u201D said Meehawl, \u201Cand go about as wall-eyed\r\nas
    Lorcan O\u2019Nualain\u2019s ass: I would that. Did you ever see his ass, sir?\r\nIt--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    did not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CDid you kill a robin redbreast?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever,\u201D
    said Meehawl. \u201CBy the pipers,\u201D he added, \u201Cthat old skinny cat\r\nof
    mine caught a bird on the roof yesterday.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHah!\u201D cried
    the Philosopher, moving, if it were possible, even closer\r\nto his client, \u201Cnow
    we have it. It is the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca\r\nMora took your washboard.
    Go to the Gort at once. There is a hole under\r\na tree in the south-east of
    the field. Try what you will find in that\r\nhole.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll
    do that,\u201D said Meehawl. \u201CDid you ever-\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not,\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\nSo Meehawl MacMurrachu went away and did as he had
    been bidden, and\r\nunderneath the tree of Gort na Cloca Mora he found a little
    crock of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a power of washboards in that,\u201D
    said he.\r\n\r\nBy reason of this incident the fame of the Philosopher became
    even\r\ngreater than it had been before, and also by reason of it many singular\r\nevents
    were to happen with which you shall duly become acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    IV\r\n\r\nIT SO happened that the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora were not\r\nthankful
    to the Philosopher for having sent Meehawl MacMurrachu to\r\ntheir field. In
    stealing Meehawl\u2019s property they were quite within their\r\nrights because
    their bird had undoubtedly been slain by his cat. Not\r\nalone, therefore, was
    their righteous vengeance nullified, but the crock\r\nof gold which had taken
    their community many thousands of years to amass\r\nwas stolen. A Leprecaun without
    a pot of gold is like a rose without\r\nperfume, a bird without a wing, or an
    inside without an outside. They\r\nconsidered that the Philosopher had treated
    them badly, that his action\r\nwas mischievous and unneighbourly, and that until
    they were adequately\r\ncompensated for their loss both of treasure and dignity,
    no conditions\r\nother than those of enmity could exist between their people
    and the\r\nlittle house in the pine wood. Furthermore, for them the situation
    was\r\ncruelly complicated. They were unable to organise a direct, personal\r\nhostility
    against their new enemy, because the Thin Woman of Inis\r\nMagrath would certainly
    protect her husband. She belonged to the Shee of\r\nCroghan Conghaile, who had
    relatives in every fairy fort in Ireland, and\r\nwere also strongly represented
    in the forts and duns of their immediate\r\nneighbours. They could, of course,
    have called an extraordinary meeting\r\nof the Sheogs, Leprecauns, and Cluricauns,
    and presented their case\r\nwith a claim for damages against the Shee of Croghan
    Conghaile, but\r\nthat Clann would assuredly repudiate any liability on the ground
    that\r\nno member of their fraternity was responsible for the outrage, as it
    was\r\nthe Philosopher, and not the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, who had done\r\nthe
    deed. Notwithstanding this they were unwilling to let the matter\r\nrest, and
    the fact that justice was out of reach only added fury to\r\ntheir anger.\r\n\r\nOne
    of their number was sent to interview the Thin Woman of Inis\r\nMagrath, and
    the others concentrated nightly about the dwelling of\r\nMeehawl MacMurrachu
    in an endeavour to recapture the treasure which\r\nthey were quite satisfied
    was hopeless. They found that Meehawl, who\r\nunderstood the customs of the Earth
    Folk very well, had buried the crock\r\nof gold beneath a thorn bush, thereby
    placing it under the protection of\r\nevery fairy in the world--the Leprecauns
    themselves included, and until\r\nit was removed from this place by human hands
    they were bound to respect\r\nits hiding-place, and even guarantee its safety
    with their blood.\r\n\r\nThey afflicted Meehawl with an extraordinary attack
    of rheumatism and\r\nhis wife with an equally virulent sciatica, but they got
    no lasting\r\npleasure from their groans.\r\n\r\nThe Leprecaun, who had been
    detailed to visit the Thin Woman of Inis\r\nMagrath, duly arrived at the cottage
    in the pine wood and made his\r\ncomplaint. The little man wept as he told the
    story, and the two\r\nchildren wept out of sympathy for him. The Thin Woman said
    she was\r\ndesperately grieved by the whole unpleasant transaction, and that\r\nall
    her sympathies were with Gort na Cloca Mora, but that she must\r\ndisassociate
    herself from any responsibility in the matter as it was her\r\nhusband who was
    the culpable person, and that she had no control over\r\nhis mental processes,
    which, she concluded, was one of the seven curious\r\nthings in the world.\r\n\r\nAs
    her husband was away in a distant part of the wood nothing further\r\ncould be
    done at that time, so the Leprecaun returned again to his\r\nfellows without
    any good news, but he promised to come back early on the\r\nfollowing day. When
    the Philosopher come home late that night the Thin\r\nWoman was waiting up for
    him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoman,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cyou ought to be in
    bed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COught I indeed?\u201D said the Thin Woman. \u201CI\u2019d
    have you know that I\u2019ll go\r\nto bed when I like and get up when I like
    without asking your or any one\r\nelse\u2019s permission.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    is not true,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CYou get sleepy whether you\r\nlike
    it or not, and you awaken again without your permission being\r\nasked. Like
    many other customs such as singing, dancing, music, and\r\nacting, sleep has
    crept into popular favour as part of a religious\r\nceremonial. Nowhere can one
    go to sleep more easily than in a church.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know,\u201D
    said the Thin Woman, \u201Cthat a Leprecaun came here to-day?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do not,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cand notwithstanding the innumerable\r\ncenturies
    which have elapsed since that first sleeper (probably with\r\nextreme difficulty)
    sank into his religious trance, we can to-day sleep\r\nthrough a religious ceremony
    with an ease which would have been a source\r\nof wealth and fame to that prehistoric
    worshipper and his acolytes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you going to listen to what
    I am telling you about the Leprecaun?\u201D\r\n said the Thin Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CIt has been suggested that we go\r\nto
    sleep at night because it is then too dark to do anything else; but\r\nowls,
    who are a venerably sagacious folk, do not sleep in the night\r\ntime. Bats,
    also, are a very clear-minded race; they sleep in the\r\nbroadest day, and they
    do it in a charming manner. They clutch the\r\nbranch of a tree with their toes
    and hang head downwards--a position\r\nwhich I consider singularly happy, for
    the rush of blood to the head\r\nconsequent on this inverted position should
    engender a drowsiness and a\r\ncertain imbecility of mind which must either sleep
    or explode.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you never be done talking?\u201D shouted
    the Thin Woman passionately.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not,\u201D said the Philosopher.
    \u201CIn certain ways sleep is useful.\r\nIt is an excellent way of listening
    to an opera or seeing pictures on\r\na bioscope. As a medium for day-dreams I
    know of nothing that can equal\r\nit. As an accomplishment it is graceful, but
    as a means of spending a\r\nnight it is intolerably ridiculous. If you were going
    to say anything,\r\nmy love, please say it now, but you should always remember
    to think\r\nbefore you speak. A woman should be seen seldom but never heard.\r\nQuietness
    is the beginning of virtue. To be silent is to be beautiful.\r\nStars do not
    make a noise. Children should always be in bed. These are\r\nserious truths,
    which cannot be controverted; therefore, silence is\r\nfitting as regards them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour
    stirabout is on the hob,\u201D said the Thin Woman. \u201CYou can get it for\r\nyourself.
    I would not move the breadth of my nail if you were dying of\r\nhunger. I hope
    there\u2019s lumps in it. A Leprecaun from Gort na Cloca Mora\r\nwas here to-day.
    They\u2019ll give it to you for robbing their pot of gold.\r\nYou old thief,
    you! you lobeared, crock-kneed fat-eye!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Thin Woman whizzed suddenly
    from where she stood and leaped into\r\nbed. From beneath the blanket she turned
    a vivid, furious eye on her\r\nhusband. She was trying to give him rheumatism
    and toothache and lockjaw\r\nall at once. If she had been satisfied to concentrate
    her attention on\r\none only of these torments she might have succeeded in afflicting
    her\r\nhusband according to her wish, but she was not able to do that.\r\n\r\n\u201CFinality
    is death. Perfection is finality. Nothing is perfect. There\r\nare lumps in it,\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWHEN the Leprecaun came
    through the pine wood on the following day he\r\nmet two children at a little
    distance from the house. He raised his open\r\nright hand above his head (this
    is both the fairy and the Gaelic form of\r\nsalutation), and would have passed
    on but that a thought brought him\r\nto a halt. Sitting down before the two children
    he stared at them for a\r\nlong time, and they stared back at him. At last he
    said to the boy:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is your name, a vic vig O?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSeumas
    Beg, sir,\u201D the boy replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a little name,\u201D
    said the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s what my mother calls me, sir,\u201D
    returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat does your father call you,\u201D was the
    next question.\r\n\r\n\u201CSeumas Roghan Maelduin O\u2019Carbhail Mac an Droid.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    a big name,\u201D said the Leprecaun, and he turned to the little girl.\r\n\u201CWhat
    is your name, a cailin vig O?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBrigid Beg, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    what does your father call you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe never calls me at all,
    sir.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, Seumaseen and Breedeen, you are good little children,
    and I like\r\nyou very much. Health be with you until I come to see you again.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd
    then the Leprecaun went back the way he had come. As he went he made\r\nlittle
    jumps and cracked his fingers, and sometimes he rubbed one leg\r\nagainst the
    other.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s a nice Leprecaun,\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    like him too,\u201D said Brigid.\r\n\r\n\u201CListen,\u201D said Seumas, \u201Clet
    me be the Leprecaun, and you be the two\r\nchildren, and I will ask you our names.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    they did that.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Leprecaun came again. He sat down beside
    the children\r\nand, as before, he was silent for a little time.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre
    you not going to ask us our names, sir?\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\nHis sister
    smoothed out her dress shyly. \u201CMy name, sir, is Brigid Beg,\u201D\r\n said
    she.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you ever play Jackstones?\u201D said the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,
    sir,\u201D replied Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll teach you how to play Jackstones,\u201D
    said the Leprecaun, and he\r\npicked up some pine cones and taught the children
    that game.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you ever play Ball in the Decker?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,
    sir,\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you ever play \u2018I can make a nail
    with my ree-roraddy-O, I can make\r\na nail with my ree-ro-ray\u2019?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,
    sir,\u201D replied Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a nice game,\u201D said the
    Leprecaun, \u201Cand so is Capon-the-back, and\r\nTwenty-four yards on the Billy-goat\u2019s
    Tail, and Towns, and Relievo, and\r\nLeap-frog. I\u2019ll teach you all these
    games,\u201D said the Leprecaun, \u201Cand\r\nI\u2019ll teach you how to play
    Knifey, and Hole-and-taw, and Horneys and\r\nRobbers.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeap-frog
    is the best one to start with, so I\u2019ll teach it to you at\r\nonce. Let you
    bend down like this, Breedeen, and you bend down like that\r\na good distance
    away, Seumas. Now I jump over Breedeen\u2019s back, and then\r\nI run and jump
    over Seumaseen\u2019s back like this, and then I run ahead\r\nagain and I bend
    down. Now, Breedeen, you jump over your brother, and\r\nthen you jump over me,
    and run a good bit on and bend down again. Now,\r\nSeumas, it\u2019s your turn;
    you jump over me and then over your sister, and\r\nthen you run on and bend down
    again and I jump.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is a fine game, sir,\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is, a vic vig,--keep in your head,\u201D said the Leprecaun. \u201CThat\u2019s
    a\r\ngood jump, you couldn\u2019t beat that jump, Seumas.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    can jump better than Brigid already,\u201D replied Seumas, \u201Cand I\u2019ll
    jump\r\nas well as you do when I get more practice--keep in your head, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlmost
    without noticing it they had passed through the edge of the wood,\r\nand were
    playing into a rough field which was cumbered with big, grey\r\nrocks. It was
    the very last field in sight, and behind it the rough,\r\nheather-packed mountain
    sloped distantly away to the skyline. There was\r\na raggedy blackberry hedge
    all round the field, and there were long,\r\ntough, haggard-looking plants growing
    in clumps here and there. Near\r\na corner of this field there was a broad, low
    tree, and as they played\r\nthey came near and nearer to it. The Leprecaun gave
    a back very close to\r\nthe tree. Seumas ran and jumped and slid down a hole
    at the side of the\r\ntree. Then Brigid ran and jumped and slid down the same
    hole.\r\n\r\n\u201CDear me!\u201D said Brigid, and she flashed out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe
    Leprecaun cracked his fingers and rubbed one leg against the other,\r\nand then
    he also dived into the hole and disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nWhen the time at
    which the children usually went home had passed, the\r\nThin Woman of Inis Magrath
    became a little anxious. She had never known\r\nthem to be late for dinner before.
    There was one of the children whom\r\nshe hated; it was her own child, but as
    she had forgotten which of them\r\nwas hers, and as she loved one of them, she
    was compelled to love both\r\nfor fear of making a mistake and chastising the
    child for whom her heart\r\nsecretly yearned. Therefore, she was equally concerned
    about both of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDinner time passed and supper time arrived, but
    the children did not.\r\nAgain and again the Thin Woman went out through the
    dark pine trees and\r\ncalled until she was so hoarse that she could not even
    hear herself when\r\nshe roared. The evening wore on to the night, and while
    she waited for\r\nthe Philosopher to come in she reviewed the situation. Her
    husband had\r\nnot come in, the children had not come in, the Leprecaun had not
    returned\r\nas arranged.... A light flashed upon her. The Leprecaun had kidnapped\r\nher
    children! She announced a vengeance against the Leprecauns which\r\nwould stagger
    humanity. While in the extreme centre of her ecstasy the\r\nPhilosopher came
    through the trees and entered the house.\r\n\r\nThe Thin Woman flew to him-\u201CHusband,\u201D
    said she, \u201Cthe Leprecauns of Gort\r\nna Cloca Mora have kidnapped our children.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher gazed at her for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CKidnapping,\u201D said he,
    \u201Chas been for many centuries a favourite\r\noccupation of fairies, gypsies,
    and the brigands of the East. The usual\r\nprocedure is to attach a person and
    hold it to ransom. If the ransom is\r\nnot paid an ear or a finger may be cut
    from the captive and despatched\r\nto those interested, with the statement that
    an arm or a leg will follow\r\nin a week unless suitable arrangements are entered
    into.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you understand,\u201D said the Thin Woman passionately,
    \u201Cthat it is your\r\nown children who have been kidnapped?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CThis course, however, is rarely\r\nfollowed
    by the fairy people: they do not ordinarily steal for ransom,\r\nbut for love
    of thieving, or from some other obscure and possibly\r\nfunctional causes, and
    the victim is retained in their forts or duns\r\nuntil by the effluxion of time
    they forget their origin and become\r\npeaceable citizens of the fairy state.
    Kidnapping is not by any means\r\nconfined to either humanity or the fairy people.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMonster,\u201D
    said the Thin Woman in a deep voice, \u201Cwill you listen to me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CMany of the insectivora also\r\npractice
    this custom. Ants, for example, are a respectable race living\r\nin well-ordered
    communities. They have attained to a most complex and\r\nartificial civilization,
    and will frequently adventure far afield on\r\ncolonising or other expeditions
    from whence they return with a rich\r\nbooty of aphides and other stock, who
    thenceforward become the servants\r\nand domestic creatures of the republic.
    As they neither kill nor eat\r\ntheir captives, this practice will be termed
    kidnapping. The same may\r\nbe said of bees, a hardy and industrious race living
    in hexagonal cells\r\nwhich are very difficult to make. Sometimes, on lacking
    a queen of\r\ntheir own, they have been observed to abduct one from a less powerful\r\nneighbour,
    and use her for their own purposes without shame, mercy, or\r\nremorse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill
    you not understand?\u201D screamed the Thin Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not,\u201D
    said the Philosopher. \u201CSemi-tropical apes have been\r\nrumoured to kidnap
    children, and are reported to use them very tenderly\r\nindeed, sharing their
    coconuts, yams, plantains, and other equatorial\r\nprovender with the largest
    generosity, and conveying their delicate\r\ncaptives from tree to tree (often
    at great distances from each other and\r\nfrom the ground) with the most guarded
    solicitude and benevolence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am going to bed,\u201D said
    the Thin Woman, \u201Cyour stirabout is on the\r\nhob.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre
    there lumps in it, my dear?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope there
    are,\u201D replied the Thin Woman, and she leaped into bed.\r\n\r\nThat night
    the Philosopher was afflicted with the most extraordinary\r\nattack of rheumatism
    he had ever known, nor did he get any ease until\r\nthe grey morning wearied
    his lady into a reluctant slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE Thin
    Woman of Inis Magrath slept very late that morning, but when\r\nshe did awaken
    her impatience was so urgent that she could scarcely\r\ndelay to eat her breakfast.
    Immediately after she had eaten she put on\r\nher bonnet and shawl and went through
    the pine wood in the direction of\r\nGort na Cloca Mora. In a short time she
    reached the rocky field, and,\r\nwalking over to the tree in the southeast corner,
    she picked up a small\r\nstone and hammered loudly against the trunk of the tree.
    She hammered\r\nin a peculiar fashion, giving two knocks and then three knocks,
    and then\r\none knock. A voice came up from the hole.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is that,
    please?\u201D said the voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CBan na Droid of Inis Magrath, and
    well you know it,\u201D was her reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am coming up, Noble Woman,\u201D
    said the voice, and in another moment the\r\nLeprecaun leaped out of the hole.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere
    are Seumas and Brigid Beg?\u201D said the Thin Woman sternly.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow
    would I know where they are?\u201D replied the Leprecaun. \u201CWouldn\u2019t
    they\r\nbe at home now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf they were at home I wouldn\u2019t
    have come here looking for them,\u201D was\r\nher reply. \u201CIt is my belief
    that you have them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSearch me,\u201D said the Leprecaun, opening
    his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are down there in your little house,\u201D said
    the Thin Woman angrily,\r\n\u201Cand the sooner you let them up the better it
    will be for yourself and\r\nyour five brothers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNoble Woman,\u201D
    said the Leprecaun, \u201Cyou can go down yourself into our\r\nlittle house and
    look. I can\u2019t say fairer than that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t fit
    down there,\u201D said she. \u201CI\u2019m too big.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou know
    the way for making yourself little,\u201D replied the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    I mightn\u2019t be able to make myself big again,\u201D said the Thin Woman,\r\n\u201Cand
    then you and your dirty brothers would have it all your own way. If\r\nyou don\u2019t
    let the children up,\u201D she continued, \u201CI\u2019ll raise the Shee of\r\nCroghan
    Conghaile against you. You know what happened to the Cluricauns\r\nof Oilean
    na Glas when they stole the Queen\u2019s baby--It will be a worse\r\nthing than
    that for you. If the children are not back in my house before\r\nmoonrise this
    night, I\u2019ll go round to my people. Just tell that to your\r\nfive ugly brothers.
    Health with you,\u201D she added, and strode away.\r\n\r\n\u201CHealth with yourself,
    Noble Woman,\u201D said the Leprecaun, and he stood on\r\none leg until she was
    out of sight and then he slid down into the hole\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Thin
    Woman was going back through the pine wood she saw Meehawl\r\nMacMurrachu travelling
    in the same direction and his brows were in a\r\ntangle of perplexity.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    be with you, Meehawl MacMurrachu,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod and Mary be
    with you, ma\u2019am,\u201D he replied, \u201CI am in great trouble\r\nthis day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    wouldn\u2019t you be?\u201D said the Thin Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CI came up to have
    a talk with your husband about a particular thing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf it\u2019s
    talk you want you have come to a good house, Meehawl.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s
    a powerful man right enough,\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the
    Thin Woman spoke again. \u201CI can get the reek of\r\nhis pipe from here. Let
    you go right in to him now and I\u2019ll stay outside\r\nfor a while, for the
    sound of your two voices would give me a pain in my\r\nhead.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhatever
    will please you will please me, ma\u2019am,\u201D said her companion,\r\nand
    he went into the little house.\r\n\r\nMeehawl MacMurrachu had good reason to
    be perplexed. He was the father\r\nof one child only, and she was the most beautiful
    girl in the whole\r\nworld. The pity of it was that no one at all knew she was
    beautiful, and\r\nshe did not even know it herself. At times when she bathed
    in the eddy\r\nof a mountain stream and saw her reflection looking up from the
    placid\r\nwater she thought that she looked very nice, and then a great sadness\r\nwould
    come upon her, for what is the use of looking nice if there is\r\nnobody to see
    one\u2019s beauty? Beauty, also, is usefulness. The arts as\r\nwell as the crafts,
    the graces equally with the utilities must stand up\r\nin the marketplace and
    be judged by the gombeen men.\r\n\r\nThe only house near to her father\u2019s
    was that occupied by Bessie\r\nHannigan. The other few houses were scattered
    widely with long, quiet\r\nmiles of hill and bog between them, so that she had
    hardly seen more\r\nthan a couple of men beside her father since she was born.
    She helped\r\nher father and mother in all the small businesses of their house,
    and\r\nevery day also she drove their three cows and two goats to pasture on\r\nthe
    mountain slopes. Here through the sunny days the years had passed\r\nin a slow,
    warm thoughtlessness wherein, without thinking, many thoughts\r\nhad entered
    into her mind and many pictures hung for a moment like\r\nbirds in the thin air.
    At first, and for a long time, she had been happy\r\nenough; there were many
    things in which a child might be interested:\r\nthe spacious heavens which never
    wore the same beauty on any day; the\r\ninnumerable little creatures living among
    the grasses or in the heather;\r\nthe steep swing of a bird down from the mountain
    to the infinite plains\r\nbelow; the little flowers which were so contented each
    in its peaceful\r\nplace; the bees gathering food for their houses, and the stout
    beetles\r\nwho are always losing their way in the dusk. These things, and many\r\nothers,
    interested her. The three cows after they had grazed for a long\r\ntime would
    come and lie by her side and look at her as they chewed their\r\ncud, and the
    goats would prance from the bracken to push their heads\r\nagainst her breast
    because they loved her.\r\n\r\nIndeed, everything in her quiet world loved this
    girl: but very slowly\r\nthere was growing in her consciousness an unrest, a
    disquietude to\r\nwhich she had hitherto been a stranger. Sometimes an infinite
    weariness\r\noppressed her to the earth. A thought was born in her mind and it
    had\r\nno name. It was growing and could not be expressed. She had no words\r\nwherewith
    to meet it, to exorcise or greet this stranger who, more and\r\nmore insistently
    and pleadingly, tapped upon her doors and begged to\r\nbe spoken to, admitted
    and caressed and nourished. A thought is a real\r\nthing and words are only its
    raiment, but a thought is as shy as a\r\nvirgin; unless it is fittingly apparelled
    we may not look on its shadowy\r\nnakedness: it will fly from us and only return
    again in the darkness\r\ncrying in a thin, childish voice which we may not comprehend
    until, with\r\naching minds, listening and divining, we at last fashion for it
    those\r\nsymbols which are its protection and its banner. So she could not\r\nunderstand
    the touch that came to her from afar and yet how intimately,\r\nthe whisper so
    aloof and yet so thrillingly personal. The standard of\r\neither language or
    experience was not hers; she could listen but not\r\nthink, she could feel but
    not know, her eyes looked forward and did not\r\nsee, her hands groped in the
    sunlight and felt nothing. It was like the\r\nedge of a little wind which stirred
    her tresses but could not lift them,\r\nor the first white peep of the dawn which
    is neither light nor darkness.\r\nBut she listened, not with her ears but with
    her blood. The fingers of\r\nher soul stretched out to clasp a stranger\u2019s
    hand, and her disquietude\r\nwas quickened through with an eagerness which was
    neither physical nor\r\nmental, for neither her body nor her mind was definitely
    interested.\r\nSome dim region between these grew alarmed and watched and waited
    and\r\ndid not sleep or grow weary at all.\r\n\r\nOne morning she lay among the
    long, warm grasses. She watched a bird who\r\nsoared and sang for a little time,
    and then it sped swiftly away down\r\nthe steep air and out of sight in the blue
    distance. Even when it was\r\ngone the song seemed to ring in her ears. It seemed
    to linger with her\r\nas a faint, sweet echo, coming fitfully, with little pauses
    as though a\r\nwind disturbed it, and careless, distant eddies. After a few moments
    she\r\nknew it was not a bird. No bird\u2019s song had that consecutive melody,
    for\r\ntheir themes are as careless as their wings. She sat up and looked about\r\nher,
    but there was nothing in sight: the mountains sloped gently above\r\nher and
    away to the clear sky; around her the scattered clumps of\r\nheather were drowsing
    in the sunlight; far below she could see her\r\nfather\u2019s house, a little
    grey patch near some trees-and then the music\r\nstopped and left her wondering.\r\n\r\nShe
    could not find her goats anywhere although for a long time she\r\nsearched. They
    came to her at last of their own accord from behind a\r\nfold in the hills, and
    they were more wildly excited than she had ever\r\nseen them before. Even the
    cows forsook their solemnity and broke into\r\nawkward gambols around her. As
    she walked home that evening a strange\r\nelation taught her feet to dance. Hither
    and thither she flitted in\r\nfront of the beasts and behind them. Her feet tripped
    to a wayward\r\nmeasure. There was a tune in her ears and she danced to it, throwing\r\nher
    arms out and above her head and swaying and bending as she went.\r\nThe full
    freedom of her body was hers now: the lightness and poise and\r\ncertainty of
    her limbs delighted her, and the strength that did not\r\ntire delighted her
    also. The evening was full of peace and quietude, the\r\nmellow, dusky sunlight
    made a path for her feet, and everywhere through\r\nthe wide fields birds were
    flashing and singing, and she sang with them\r\na song that had no words and
    wanted none.\r\n\r\nThe following day she heard the music again, faint and thin,
    wonderfully\r\nsweet and as wild as the song of a bird, but it was a melody which\r\nno
    bird would adhere to. A theme was repeated again and again. In the\r\nmiddle
    of trills, grace-notes, runs and catches it recurred with a\r\nstrange, almost
    holy, solemnity,--a hushing, slender melody full of\r\nausterity and aloofness.
    There was something in it to set her heart\r\nbeating. She yearned to it with
    her ears and her lips. Was it joy,\r\nmenace, carelessness? She did not know,
    but this she did know, that\r\nhowever terrible it was personal to her. It was
    her unborn thought\r\nstrangely audible and felt rather than understood.\r\n\r\nOn
    that day she did not see anybody either. She drove her charges home\r\nin the
    evening listlessly and the beasts also were very quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen the music
    came again she made no effort to discover where it came\r\nfrom. She only listened,
    and when the tune was ended she saw a figure\r\nrise from the fold of a little
    hill. The sunlight was gleaming from his\r\narms and shoulders but the rest of
    his body was hidden by the bracken,\r\nand he did not look at her as he went
    away playing softly on a double\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nThe next day he did look at her.
    He stood waist-deep in greenery\r\nfronting her squarely. She had never seen
    so strange a face before. Her\r\neyes almost died on him as she gazed and he
    returned her look for a long\r\nminute with an intent, expressionless regard.
    His hair was a cluster of\r\nbrown curls, his nose was little and straight, and
    his wide mouth\r\ndrooped sadly at the corners. His eyes were wide and most mournful,
    and\r\nhis forehead was very broad and white. His sad eyes and mouth almost\r\nmade
    her weep.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned away he smiled at her, and it was as though the
    sun had\r\nshone suddenly in a dark place, banishing all sadness and gloom. Then
    he\r\nwent mincingly away. As he went he lifted the slender double reed to his\r\nlips
    and blew a few careless notes.\r\n\r\nThe next day he fronted her as before,
    looking down to her eyes from a\r\nshort distance. He played for only a few moments,
    and fitfully, and then\r\nhe came to her. When he left the bracken the girl suddenly
    clapped\r\nher hands against her eyes affrighted. There was something different,\r\nterrible
    about him. The upper part of his body was beautiful, but the\r\nlower part....
    She dared not look at him again. She would have risen and\r\nfled away but she
    feared he might pursue her, and the thought of such\r\na chase and the inevitable
    capture froze her blood. The thought of\r\nanything behind us is always terrible.
    The sound of pursuing feet is\r\nworse than the murder from which we fly--So
    she sat still and waited but\r\nnothing happened. At last, desperately, she dropped
    her hands. He was\r\nsitting on the ground a few paces from her. He was not looking
    at her\r\nbut far away sidewards across the spreading hill. His legs were crossed;\r\nthey
    were shaggy and hoofed like the legs of a goat: but she would not\r\nlook at
    these because of his wonderful, sad, grotesque face. Gaiety is\r\ngood to look
    upon and an innocent face is delightful to our souls,\r\nbut no woman can resist
    sadness or weakness, and ugliness she dare\r\nnot resist. Her nature leaps to
    be the comforter. It is her reason. It\r\nexalts her to an ecstasy wherein nothing
    but the sacrifice of herself\r\nhas any proportion. Men are not fathers by instinct
    but by chance, but\r\nwomen are mothers beyond thought, beyond instinct which
    is the father\r\nof thought. Motherliness, pity, self-sacrifice--these are the
    charges\r\nof her primal cell, and not even the discovery that men are comedians,\r\nliars,
    and egotists will wean her from this. As she looked at the pathos\r\nof his face
    she repudiated the hideousness of his body. The beast\r\nwhich is in all men
    is glossed by women; it is his childishness, the\r\ndestructive energy inseparable
    from youth and high spirits, and it is\r\nalways forgiven by women, often forgotten,
    sometimes, and not rarely,\r\ncherished and fostered.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments
    of this silence he placed the reed to his lips and\r\nplayed a plaintive little
    air, and then he spoke to her in a strange\r\nvoice, coming like a wind from
    distant places.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is your name, Shepherd Girl?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CCaitilin,
    Ingin Ni Murrachu,\u201D she whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201CDaughter of Murrachu,\u201D
    said he, \u201CI have come from a far place where\r\nthere are high hills. The
    men and maidens who follow their flocks in\r\nthat place know me and love me
    for I am the Master of the Shepherds.\r\nThey sing and dance and are glad when
    I come to them in the sunlight;\r\nbut in this country no people have done any
    reverence to me. The\r\nshepherds fly away when they hear my pipes in the pastures;
    the maidens\r\nscream in fear when I dance to them in the meadows. I am very
    lonely in\r\nthis strange country. You also, although you danced to the music
    of my\r\npipes, have covered your face against me and made no reverence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will do whatever you say if it is right,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must
    not do anything because it is right, but because it is your\r\nwish. Right is
    a word and Wrong is a word, but the sun shines in the\r\nmorning and the dew
    falls in the dusk without thinking of these words\r\nwhich have no meaning. The
    bee flies to the flower and the seed goes\r\nabroad and is happy. Is that right,
    Shepherd Girl?--it is wrong also.\r\nI come to you because the bee goes to the
    flower--it is wrong! If I did\r\nnot come to you to whom would I go? There is
    no right and no wrong but\r\nonly the will of the gods.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am afraid of you,\u201D said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou fear me because my legs
    are shaggy like the legs of a goat. Look at\r\nthem well, O Maiden, and know
    that they are indeed the legs of a beast\r\nand then you will not be afraid any
    more. Do you not love beasts? Surely\r\nyou should love them for they yearn to
    you humbly or fiercely, craving\r\nyour hand upon their heads as I do. If I were
    not fashioned thus I would\r\nnot come to you because I would not need you. Man
    is a god and a brute.\r\nHe aspires to the stars with his head but his feet are
    contented in\r\nthe grasses of the field, and when he forsakes the brute upon
    which he\r\nstands then there will be no more men and no more women and the immortal\r\ngods
    will blow this world away like smoke.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what
    you want me to do,\u201D said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want you to want me. I
    want you to forget right and wrong; to be as\r\nhappy as the beasts, as careless
    as the flowers and the birds. To live\r\nto the depths of your nature as well
    as to the heights. Truly there are\r\nstars in the heights and they will be a
    garland for your forehead. But\r\nthe depths are equal to the heights. Wondrous
    deep are the depths, very\r\nfertile is the lowest deep. There are stars there
    also, brighter than\r\nthe stars on high. The name of the heights is Wisdom and
    the name of the\r\ndepths is Love. How shall they come together and be fruitful
    if you do\r\nnot plunge deeply and fearlessly? Wisdom is the spirit and the wings
    of\r\nthe spirit, Love is the shaggy beast that goes down. Gallantly he dives,\r\nbelow
    thought, beyond Wisdom, to rise again as high above these as he\r\nhad first
    descended. Wisdom is righteous and clean, but Love is unclean\r\nand holy. I
    sing of the beast and the descent: the great unclean purging\r\nitself in fire:
    the thought that is not born in the measure or the ice\r\nor the head, but in
    the feet and the hot blood and the pulse of fury.\r\nThe Crown of Life is not
    lodged in the sun: the wise gods have buried it\r\ndeeply where the thoughtful
    will not find it, nor the good: but the Gay\r\nOnes, the Adventurous Ones, the
    Careless Plungers, they will bring it to\r\nthe wise and astonish them. All things
    are seen in the light--How shall\r\nwe value that which is easy to see? But the
    precious things which\r\nare hidden, they will be more precious for our search:
    they will be\r\nbeautiful with our sorrow: they will be noble because of our
    desire for\r\nthem. Come away with me, Shepherd Girl, through the fields, and
    we will\r\nbe careless and happy, and we will leave thought to find us when it
    can,\r\nfor that is the duty of thought, and it is more anxious to discover us\r\nthan
    we are to be found.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Caitilin Ni Murrachu arose and went with
    him through the fields, and\r\nshe did not go with him because of love, nor because
    his words had been\r\nunderstood by her, but only because he was naked and unashamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    VII\r\n\r\nIT was on account of his daughter that Meehawl MacMurrachu had come
    to\r\nvisit the Philosopher. He did not know what had become of her, and the\r\nfacts
    he had to lay before his adviser were very few.\r\n\r\nHe left the Thin Woman
    of Inis Magrath taking snuff under a pine tree\r\nand went into the house.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    be with all here,\u201D said he as he entered.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod be with yourself,
    Meehawl MacMurrachu,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am in great trouble
    this day, sir,\u201D said Meehawl, \u201Cand if you would\r\ngive me an advice
    I\u2019d be greatly beholden to you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can give you that,\u201D
    replied the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CNone better than your honour and no trouble
    to you either. It was a\r\npowerful advice you gave me about the washboard, and
    if I didn\u2019t come\r\nhere to thank you before this it was not because I didn\u2019t
    want to come,\r\nbut that I couldn\u2019t move hand or foot by dint of the cruel
    rheumatism\r\nput upon me by the Leprecauns of Gort na Cloca Mora, bad cess to
    them\r\nfor ever: twisted I was the way you\u2019d get a squint in your eye if
    you\r\nonly looked at me, and the pain I suffered would astonish you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    would not,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo matter,\u201D said Meehawl.
    \u201CWhat I came about was my young daughter\r\nCaitilin. Sight or light of
    her I haven\u2019t had for three days. My wife\r\nsaid first, that it was the
    fairies had taken her, and then she said it\r\nwas a travelling man that had
    a musical instrument she went away with,\r\nand after that she said, that maybe
    the girl was lying dead in the butt\r\nof a ditch with her eyes wide open, and
    she staring broadly at the\r\nmoon in the night time and the sun in the day until
    the crows would be\r\nfinding her out.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher drew his
    chair closer to Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CDaughters,\u201D said he, \u201Chave been
    a cause of anxiety to their parents\r\never since they were instituted. The flightiness
    of the female\r\ntemperament is very evident in those who have not arrived at
    the\r\nyears which teach how to hide faults and frailties, and, therefore,\r\nindiscretions
    bristle from a young girl the way branches do from a\r\nbush.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    person who would deny that--\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CFemale children,
    however, have the particular sanction of nature. They\r\nare produced in astonishing
    excess over males, and may, accordingly,\r\nbe admitted as dominant to the male;
    but the well-proven law that the\r\nminority shall always control the majority
    will relieve our minds from a\r\nfear which might otherwise become intolerable.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    true enough,\u201D said Meehawl. \u201CHave you noticed, sir, that in a\r\nlitter
    of pups--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CCertain
    trades and professions,\r\nit is curious to note, tend to be perpetuated in the
    female line. The\r\nsovereign profession among bees and ants is always female,
    and publicans\r\nalso descend on the distaff side. You will have noticed that
    every\r\npublican has three daughters of extraordinary charms. Lacking these\r\nsigns
    we would do well to look askance at such a man\u2019s liquor, divining\r\nthat
    in his brew there will be an undue percentage of water, for if his\r\nprimogeniture
    is infected how shall his honesty escape?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would take a
    wise head to answer that,\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would not,\u201D
    said the Philosopher. \u201CThroughout nature the female\r\ntends to polygamy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf,\u201D
    said Meehawl, \u201Cthat unfortunate daughter of mine is lying dead in\r\na ditch--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CMany races have endeavoured\r\nto
    place some limits to this increase in females. Certain Oriental\r\npeoples have
    conferred the titles of divinity on crocodiles, serpents,\r\nand tigers of the
    jungle, and have fed these with their surplusage\r\nof daughters. In China, likewise,
    such sacrifices are defended as\r\nhonourable and economic practices. But, broadly
    speaking, if daughters\r\nhave to be curtailed I prefer your method of losing
    them rather than the\r\nreligio-hysterical compromises of the Orient.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    give you my word, sir,\u201D said Meehawl, \u201Cthat I don\u2019t know what
    you are\r\ntalking about at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat,\u201D said the Philosopher,
    \u201Cmay be accounted for in three\r\nways--firstly, there is a lack of cerebral
    continuity: that is, faulty\r\nattention; secondly, it might be due to a local
    peculiarity in the\r\nconformation of the skull, or, perhaps, a superficial instead
    of a deep\r\nindenting of the cerebral coil; and thirdly--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid
    you ever hear,\u201D said Meehawl, \u201Cof the man that had the scalp of his\r\nhead
    blown off by a gun, and they soldered the bottom of a tin dish to\r\nthe top
    of his skull the way you could hear his brains ticking inside of\r\nit for all
    the world like a Waterbury watch?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not,\u201D said the
    Philosopher. \u201CThirdly, it may--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s my daughter,
    Caitilin, sir,\u201D said Meehawl humbly. \u201CMaybe she is\r\nlying in the
    butt of a ditch and the crows picking her eyes out.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did
    she die of?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy wife only put it that
    maybe she was dead, and that maybe she was\r\ntaken by the fairies, and that
    maybe she went away with the travelling\r\nman that had the musical instrument.
    She said it was a concertina, but I\r\nthink myself it was a flute he had.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    was this traveller?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never saw him,\u201D said Meehawl, \u201Cbut
    one day I went a few perches up\r\nthe hill and I heard him playing--thin, squeaky
    music it was like you\u2019d\r\nbe blowing out of a tin whistle. I looked about
    for him everywhere, but\r\nnot a bit of him could I see.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEh?\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI looked about--\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    know,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CDid you happen to look at your goats?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    couldn\u2019t well help doing that,\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat were
    they doing?\u201D said the Philosopher eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey were bucking
    each other across the field, and standing on their\r\nhind legs and cutting such
    capers that I laughed till I had a pain in my\r\nstomach at the gait of them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThis
    is very interesting,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you tell me
    so?\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cand
    for this reason-most of the races of\r\nthe world have at one time or another--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    my little daughter, Caitilin, sir,\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m
    attending to her,\u201D the Philosopher replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thank you kindly,\u201D
    returned Meehawl.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher continued \u201CMost of the races of
    the world have at one\r\ntime or another been visited by this deity, whose title
    is the \u2018Great\r\nGod Pan,\u2019 but there is no record of his ever having
    journeyed to\r\nIreland, and, certainly within historic times, he has not set
    foot on\r\nthese shores. He lived for a great number of years in Egypt, Persia,\r\nand
    Greece, and although his empire is supposed to be world-wide, this\r\nuniversal
    sway has always been, and always will be, contested; but\r\nnevertheless, however
    sharply his empire may be curtailed, he will never\r\nbe without a kingdom wherein
    his exercise of sovereign rights will be\r\ngladly and passionately acclaimed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    he one of the old gods, sir?\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is,\u201D replied
    the Philosopher, \u201Cand his coming intends no good\r\nto this country. Have
    you any idea why he should have captured your\r\ndaughter?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot
    an idea in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs your daughter beautiful?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    couldn\u2019t tell you, because I never thought of looking at her that\r\nway.
    But she is a good milker, and as strong as a man. She can lift a\r\nbag of meal
    under her arm easier than I can; but she\u2019s a timid creature\r\nfor all that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhatever
    the reason is I am certain that he has the girl, and I am\r\ninclined to think
    that he was directed to her by the Leprecauns of\r\nthe Gort. You know they are
    at feud with you ever since their bird was\r\nkilled?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am
    not likely to forget it, and they racking me day and night with\r\ntorments.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    may be sure,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cthat if he\u2019s anywhere at
    all\r\nit\u2019s at Gort na Cloca Mora he is, for, being a stranger, he wouldn\u2019t\r\nknow
    where to go unless he was directed, and they know every hole and\r\ncorner of
    this countryside since ancient times. I\u2019d go up myself and\r\nhave a talk
    with him, but it wouldn\u2019t be a bit of good, and it wouldn\u2019t\r\nbe any
    use your going either. He has power over all grown people so that\r\nthey either
    go and get drunk or else they fall in love with every person\r\nthey meet, and
    commit assaults and things I wouldn\u2019t like to be telling\r\nyou about. The
    only folk who can go near him at all are little children,\r\nbecause he has no
    power over them until they grow to the sensual age,\r\nand then he exercises
    lordship over them as over every one else. I\u2019ll\r\nsend my two children
    with a message to him to say that he isn\u2019t doing\r\nthe decent thing, and
    that if he doesn\u2019t let the girl alone and go back\r\nto his own country
    we\u2019ll send for Angus Og.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019d make short work of
    him, I\u2019m thinking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe might surely; but he may take the
    girl for himself all the same.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019d sooner he had
    her than the other one, for he\u2019s one of\r\nourselves anyhow, and the devil
    you know is better than the devil you\r\ndon\u2019t know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAngus
    Og is a god,\u201D said the Philosopher severely.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know that, sir,\u201D
    replied Meehawl; \u201Cit\u2019s only a way of talking I have.\r\nBut how will
    your honour get at Angus? for I heard say that he hadn\u2019t\r\nbeen seen for
    a hundred years, except one night only when he talked to a\r\nman for half an
    hour on Kilmasheogue.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll find him, sure enough,\u201D
    replied the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll warrant you will,\u201D replied
    Meehawl heartily as he stood up. \u201CLong\r\nlife and good health to your honour,\u201D
    said he as he turned away.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher lit his pipe.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    live as long as we are let,\u201D said he, \u201Cand we get the health we\r\ndeserve.
    Your salutation embodies a reflection on death which is not\r\nphilosophic. We
    must acquiesce in all logical progressions. The merging\r\nof opposites is completion.
    Life runs to death as to its goal, and we\r\nshould go towards that next stage
    of experience either carelessly as to\r\nwhat must be, or with a good, honest
    curiosity as to what may be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s not much fun in
    being dead, sir,\u201D said Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know?\u201D said
    the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know well enough,\u201D replied Meehawl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    VIII\r\n\r\nWHEN the children leaped into the hole at the foot of the tree they\r\nfound
    themselves sliding down a dark, narrow slant which dropped them\r\nsoftly enough
    into a little room. This room was hollowed out immediately\r\nunder the tree,
    and great care had been taken not to disturb any of\r\nthe roots which ran here
    and there through the chamber in the strangest\r\ncriss-cross, twisted fashion.
    To get across such a place one had to walk\r\nround, and jump over, and duck
    under perpetually. Some of the roots had\r\nformed themselves very conveniently
    into low seats and narrow, uneven\r\ntables, and at the bottom all the roots
    ran into the floor and away\r\nagain in the direction required by their business.
    After the clear air\r\noutside this place was very dark to the children\u2019s
    eyes, so that they\r\ncould not see anything for a few minutes, but after a little
    time their\r\neyes became accustomed to the semiobscurity and they were able
    to see\r\nquite well. The first things they became aware of were six small men
    who\r\nwere seated on low roots. They were all dressed in tight green clothes\r\nand
    little leathern aprons, and they wore tall green hats which wobbled\r\nwhen they
    moved. They were all busily engaged making shoes. One was\r\ndrawing out wax
    ends on his knee, another was softening pieces of\r\nleather in a bucket of water,
    another was polishing the instep of a shoe\r\nwith a piece of curved bone, another
    was paring down a heel with a short\r\nbroad-bladed knife, and another was hammering
    wooden pegs into a sole.\r\nHe had all the pegs in his mouth, which gave him
    a widefaced, jolly\r\nexpression, and according as a peg was wanted he blew it
    into his hand\r\nand hit it twice with his hammer, and then he blew another peg,
    and he\r\nalways blew the peg with the right end uppermost, and never had to
    hit\r\nit more than twice. He was a person well worth watching.\r\n\r\nThe children
    had slid down so unexpectedly that they almost forgot their\r\ngood manners,
    but as soon as Seumas Beg discovered that he was really in\r\na room he removed
    his cap and stood up.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod be with all here,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nThe
    Leprecaun who had brought them lifted Brigid from the floor to which\r\namazement
    still constrained her.\r\n\r\n\u201CSit down on that little root, child of my
    heart,\u201D said he, \u201Cand you can\r\nknit stockings for us.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,
    sir,\u201D said Brigid meekly.\r\n\r\nThe Leprecaun took four knitting needles
    and a ball of green wool from\r\nthe top of a high, horizontal root. He had to
    climb over one, go round\r\nthree and climb up two roots to get at it, and he
    did this so easily\r\nthat it did not seem a bit of trouble. He gave the needles
    and wool to\r\nBrigid Beg.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know how to turn the heel, Brigid
    Beg?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, sir,\u201D said Brigid.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,
    I\u2019ll show you how when you come to it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other six Leprecauns
    had ceased work and were looking at the\r\nchildren. Seumas turned to them.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod
    bless the work,\u201D said he politely.\r\n\r\nOne of the Leprecauns, who had
    a grey, puckered face and a thin fringe\r\nof grey whisker very far under his
    chin, then spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome over here, Seumas Beg,\u201D said he, \u201Cand
    I\u2019ll measure you for a pair\r\nof shoes. Put your foot up on that root.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    boy did so, and the Leprecaun took the measure of his foot with a\r\nwooden rule.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,
    Brigid Beg, show me your foot,\u201D and he measured her also. \u201CThey\u2019ll\r\nbe
    ready for you in the morning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you never do anything else
    but make shoes, sir?\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe do not,\u201D replied
    the Leprecaun, \u201Cexcept when we want new clothes,\r\nand then we have to
    make them, but we grudge every minute spent making\r\nanything else except shoes,
    because that is the proper work for a\r\nLeprecaun. In the night time we go about
    the country into people\u2019s\r\nhouses and we clip little pieces off their
    money, and so, bit by bit,\r\nwe get a crock of gold together, because, do you
    see, a Leprecaun has to\r\nhave a crock of gold so that if he\u2019s captured
    by men folk he may be\r\nable to ransom himself. But that seldom happens, because
    it\u2019s a great\r\ndisgrace altogether to be captured by a man, and we\u2019ve
    practiced so long\r\ndodging among the roots here that we can easily get away
    from them. Of\r\ncourse, now and again we are caught; but men are fools, and
    we always\r\nescape without having to pay the ransom at all. We wear green clothes\r\nbecause
    it\u2019s the colour of the grass and the leaves, and when we sit\r\ndown under
    a bush or lie in the grass they just walk by without noticing\r\nus.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill
    you let me see your crock of gold?\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\nThe Leprecaun looked
    at him fixedly for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you like griddle bread and milk?\u201D
    said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CI like it well,\u201D Seumas answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen
    you had better have some,\u201D and the Leprecaun took a piece of\r\ngriddle
    bread from the shelf and filled two saucers with milk.\r\n\r\nWhile the children
    were eating the Leprecauns asked them many questions\r\n\u201CWhat time do you
    get up in the morning?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSeven o\u2019clock,\u201D replied Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    what do you have for breakfast?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStirabout and milk,\u201D
    he replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s good food,\u201D said the Leprecaun. \u201CWhat
    do you have for dinner?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPotatoes and milk,\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    not bad at all,\u201D said the Leprecaun. \u201CAnd what do you have for\r\nsupper?\u201D\r\n\r\nBrigid
    answered this time because her brother\u2019s mouth was full.\r\n\r\n\u201CBread
    and milk, sir,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s nothing better,\u201D
    said the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd then we go to bed,\u201D continued Brigid.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    wouldn\u2019t you?\u201D said the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point the
    Thin Woman of Inis Magrath knocked on the tree\r\ntrunk and demanded that the
    children should be returned to her.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone away the Leprecauns
    held a consultation, whereat it\r\nwas decided that they could not afford to
    anger the Thin Woman and the\r\nShee of Croghan Conghaile, so they shook hands
    with the children and\r\nbade them good-bye. The Leprecaun who had enticed them
    away from home\r\nbrought them back again, and on parting he begged the children
    to visit\r\nGort na Cloca Mora whenever they felt inclined.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s
    always a bit of griddle bread or potato cake, and a noggin of\r\nmilk for a friend,\u201D
    said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are very kind, sir,\u201D replied Seumas, and his sister
    said the same\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAs the Leprecaun walked away they stood watching
    him.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you remember,\u201D said Seumas, \u201Cthe way he hopped
    and waggled his leg\r\nthe last time he was here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do so,\u201D
    replied Brigid.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, he isn\u2019t hopping or doing anything at
    all this time,\u201D said\r\nSeumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s not in good humour
    to-night,\u201D said Brigid, \u201Cbut I like him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo do I,\u201D
    said Seumas.\r\n\r\nWhen they went into the house the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath
    was very\r\nglad to see them, and she baked a cake with currants in it, and also\r\ngave
    them both stir-about and potatoes; but the Philosopher did not\r\nnotice that
    they had been away at all. He said at last that \u201Ctalking was\r\nbad wit,
    that women were always making a fuss, that children should be\r\nfed, but not
    fattened, and that beds were meant to be slept in.\u201D The Thin\r\nWoman replied
    \u201Cthat he was a grisly old man without bowels, that she did\r\nnot know what
    she had married him for, that he was three times her age,\r\nand that no one
    would believe what she had to put up with.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPURSUANT
    to his arrangement with Meehawl MacMurrachu, the Philosopher\r\nsent the children
    in search of Pan. He gave them the fullest\r\ninstructions as to how they should
    address the Sylvan Deity, and then,\r\nhaving received the admonishments of the
    Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, the\r\nchildren departed in the early morning.\r\n\r\nWhen
    they reached the clearing in the pine wood, through which the sun\r\nwas blazing,
    they sat down for a little while to rest in the heat. Birds\r\nwere continually
    darting down this leafy shaft, and diving away into the\r\ndark wood. These birds
    always had something in their beaks. One would\r\nhave a worm, or a snail, or
    a grasshopper, or a little piece of wool\r\ntorn off a sheep, or a scrap of cloth,
    or a piece of hay; and when they\r\nhad put these things in a certain place they
    flew up the sun-shaft again\r\nand looked for something else to bring home. On
    seeing the children each\r\nof the birds waggled his wings, and made a particular
    sound. They said\r\n\u201Ccaw\u201D and \u201Cchip\u201D and \u201Ctwit\u201D
    and \u201Ctut\u201D and \u201Cwhat\u201D and \u201Cpit\u201D; and one,\r\nwhom
    the youngsters liked very much, always said \u201Ctit-tittit-tit-tit.\u201D\r\nThe
    children were fond of him because he was so all-of-asudden. They\r\nnever knew
    where he was going to fly next, and they did not believe he\r\nknew himself.
    He would fly backwards and forwards, and up and down, and\r\nsideways and bawways--all,
    so to speak, in the one breath. He did this\r\nbecause he was curious to see
    what was happening everywhere, and, as\r\nsomething is always happening everywhere,
    he was never able to fly in\r\na straight line for more than the littlest distance.
    He was a cowardly\r\nbird too, and continually fancied that some person was going
    to throw\r\na stone at him from behind a bush, or a wall, or a tree, and these\r\nimaginary
    dangers tended to make his journeyings still more wayward and\r\nerratic. He
    never flew where he wanted to go himself, but only where God\r\ndirected him,
    and so he did not fare at all badly.\r\n\r\nThe children knew each of the birds
    by their sounds, and always said\r\nthese words to them when they came near.
    For a little time they had\r\ndifficulty in saying the right word to the right
    bird, and sometimes\r\nsaid \u201Cchip\u201D when the salutation should have
    been \u201Ctut.\u201D The birds always\r\nresented this, and would scold them
    angrily, but after a little practice\r\nthey never made any mistakes at all.
    There was one bird, a big, black\r\nfellow, who loved to be talked to. He used
    to sit on the ground beside\r\nthe children, and say \u201Ccaw\u201D as long
    as they would repeat it after him.\r\nHe often wasted a whole morning in talk,
    but none of the other birds\r\nremained for more than a few minutes at a time.
    They were always busy\r\nin the morning, but in the evening they had more leisure,
    and would stay\r\nand chat as long as the children wanted them. The awkward thing
    was that\r\nin the evening all the birds wanted to talk at the same moment, so
    that\r\nthe youngsters never knew which of them to answer. Seumas Beg got out\r\nof
    that difficulty for a while by learning to whistle their notes, but,\r\neven
    so, they spoke with such rapidity that he could not by any means\r\nkeep pace
    with them. Brigid could only whistle one note; it was a little\r\nflat \u201Cwhoo\u201D
    sound, which the birds all laughed at, and after a few\r\ntrials she refused
    to whistle any more.\r\n\r\nWhile they were sitting two rabbits came to play
    about in the brush.\r\nThey ran round and round in a circle, and all their movements
    were very\r\nquick and twisty. Sometimes they jumped over each other six or seven\r\ntimes
    in succession, and every now and then they sat upright on their\r\nhind legs,
    and washed their faces with their paws. At other times they\r\npicked up a blade
    of grass, which they ate with great deliberation,\r\npretending all the time
    that it was a complicated banquet of cabbage\r\nleaves and lettuce.\r\n\r\nWhile
    the children were playing with the rabbits an ancient, stalwart\r\nhe-goat came
    prancing through the bracken. He was an old acquaintance of\r\ntheirs, and he
    enjoyed lying beside them to have his forehead scratched\r\nwith a piece of sharp
    stick. His forehead was hard as rock, and the hair\r\ngrew there as sparse as
    grass does on a wall, or rather the way moss\r\ngrows on a wall--it was a mat
    instead of a crop. His horns were long and\r\nvery sharp, and brilliantly polished.
    On this day the he-goat had two\r\nchains around his neck--one was made of butter-cups
    and the other was\r\nmade of daisies, and the children wondered to each other
    who it was\r\ncould have woven these so carefully. They asked the he-goat this\r\nquestion,
    but he only looked at them and did not say a word. The\r\nchildren liked examining
    this goat\u2019s eyes; they were very big, and of\r\nthe queerest light-gray
    colour. They had a strange steadfast look, and\r\nhad also at times a look of
    queer, deep intelligence, and at other times\r\nthey had a fatherly and benevolent
    expression, and at other times\r\nagain, especially when he looked sidewards,
    they had a mischievous,\r\nlight-and-airy, daring, mocking, inviting and terrifying
    look; but he\r\nalways looked brave and unconcerned. When the he-goat\u2019s
    forehead had\r\nbeen scratched as much as he desired he arose from between the
    children\r\nand went pacing away lightly through the wood. The children ran after\r\nhim
    and each caught hold of one of his horns, and he ambled and reared\r\nbetween
    them while they danced along on his either side singing snatches\r\nof bird songs,
    and scraps of old tunes which the Thin Woman of Inis\r\nMagrath had learned among
    the people of the Shee.\r\n\r\nIn a little time they came to Gort na Cloca Mora,
    but here the he-goat\r\ndid not stop. They went past the big tree of the Leprecauns,
    through\r\na broken part of the hedge and into another rough field. The sun was\r\nshining
    gloriously. There was scarcely a wind at all to stir the harsh\r\ngrasses. Far
    and near was silence and warmth, an immense, cheerful\r\npeace. Across the sky
    a few light clouds sailed gently on a blue so vast\r\nthat the eye failed before
    that horizon. A few bees sounded their deep\r\nchant, and now and again a wasp
    rasped hastily on his journey. Than\r\nthese there was no sound of any kind.
    So peaceful, innocent and safe did\r\neverything appear that it might have been
    the childhood of the world as\r\nit was of the morning.\r\n\r\nThe children,
    still clinging to the friendly goat, came near the edge\r\nof the field, which
    here sloped more steeply to the mountain top. Great\r\nboulders, slightly covered
    with lichen and moss, were strewn about, and\r\naround them the bracken and gorse
    were growing, and in every crevice of\r\nthese rocks there were plants whose
    little, tight-fisted roots gripped\r\na desperate, adventurous habitation in
    a soil scarcely more than half\r\nan inch deep. At some time these rocks had
    been smitten so fiercely that\r\nthe solid granite surfaces had shattered into
    fragments. At one place\r\na sheer wall of stone, ragged and battered, looked
    harshly out from the\r\nthin vegetation. To this rocky wall the he-goat danced.
    At one place\r\nthere was a hole in the wall covered by a thick brush. The goat
    pushed\r\nhis way behind this growth and disappeared. Then the children, curious\r\nto
    see where he had gone, pushed through also. Behind the bush they\r\nfound a high,
    narrow opening, and when they had rubbed their legs, which\r\nsmarted from the
    stings of nettles, thistles and gorse prickles, they\r\nwent into the hole which
    they thought was a place the goat had for\r\nsleeping in on cold, wet nights.
    After a few paces they found the\r\npassage was quite comfortably big, and then
    they saw a light, and\r\nin another moment they were blinking at the god Pan
    and Caitilin Ni\r\nMurrachu.\r\n\r\nCaitilin knew them at once and came forward
    with welcome.\r\n\r\n\u201CO, Seumas Beg,\u201D she cried reproachfully, \u201Chow
    dirty you have let your\r\nfeet get. Why don\u2019t you walk in the grassy places?
    And you, Brigid, have\r\na right to be ashamed of yourself to have your hands
    the way they are.\r\nCome over here at once.\u201D\r\n\r\nEvery child knows that
    every grown female person in the world has\r\nauthority to wash children and
    to give them food; that is what grown\r\npeople were made for, consequently Seumas
    and Brigid Beg submitted to\r\nthe scouring for which Caitilin made instant preparation.
    When they were\r\ncleaned she pointed to a couple of flat stones against the
    wall of the\r\ncave and bade them sit down and be good, and this the children
    did,\r\nfixing their eyes on Pan with the cheerful gravity and curiosity which\r\ngood-natured
    youngsters always give to a stranger.\r\n\r\nPan, who had been lying on a couch
    of dried grass, sat up and bent an\r\nequally cheerful regard on the children.\r\n\r\n\u201CShepherd
    Girl,\u201D said he, \u201Cwho are those children?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are
    the children of the Philosophers of Coilla Doraca; the\r\nGrey Woman of Dun Gortin
    and the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath are their\r\nmothers, and they are decent,
    poor children, God bless them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat have they come here for?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    will have to ask themselves that.\u201D\r\n\r\nPan looked at them smilingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    have you come here for, little children?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nThe children questioned
    one another with their eyes to see which of them\r\nwould reply, and then Seumas
    Beg answered:\r\n\r\n\u201CMy father sent me to see you, sir, and to say that
    you were not doing a\r\ngood thing in keeping Caitilin Ni Murrachu away from
    her own place.\u201D\r\n\r\nBrigid Beg turned to Caitilin-\u201CYour father came
    to see our father, and\r\nhe said that he didn\u2019t know what had become of
    you at all, and that\r\nmaybe you were lying flat in a ditch with the black crows
    picking at\r\nyour flesh.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what,\u201D said Pan, \u201Cdid
    your father say to that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe told us to come and ask her to
    go home.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you love your father, little child?\u201D said
    Pan.\r\n\r\nBrigid Beg thought for a moment. \u201CI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201D
    she replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe doesn\u2019t mind us at all,\u201D broke in Seumas
    Beg, \u201Cand so we don\u2019t know\r\nwhether we love him or not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    like Caitilin,\u201D said Brigid, \u201Cand I like you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo
    do I,\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CI like you also, little children,\u201D
    said Pan. \u201CCome over here and sit\r\nbeside me, and we will talk.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    the two children went over to Pan and sat down one each side of him,\r\nand he
    put his arms about them. \u201CDaughter of Murrachu,\u201D said he, \u201Cis\r\nthere
    no food in the house for guests?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is a cake of bread,
    a little goat\u2019s milk and some cheese,\u201D she\r\nreplied, and she set
    about getting these things.\r\n\r\n\u201CI never ate cheese,\u201D said Seumas.
    \u201CIs it good?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSurely it is,\u201D replied Pan. \u201CThe
    cheese that is made from goat\u2019s milk\r\nis rather strong, and it is good
    to be eaten by people who live in the\r\nopen air, but not by those who live
    in houses, for such people do not\r\nhave any appetite. They are poor creatures
    whom I do not like.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI like eating,\u201D said Seumas.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo
    do I,\u201D said Pan. \u201CAll good people like eating. Every person who is\r\nhungry
    is a good person, and every person who is not hungry is a bad\r\nperson. It is
    better to be hungry than rich.\u201D\r\n\r\nCaitilin having supplied the children
    with food, seated herself in front\r\nof them. \u201CI don\u2019t think that
    is right,\u201D said she. \u201CI have always been\r\nhungry, and it was never
    good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you had always been full you would like it even less,\u201D
    he replied,\r\n\u201Cbecause when you are hungry you are alive, and when you
    are not hungry\r\nyou are only half alive.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne has to be poor
    to be hungry,\u201D replied Caitilin. \u201CMy father is poor\r\nand gets no
    good of it but to work from morning to night and never to\r\nstop doing that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is bad for a wise person to be poor,\u201D said Pan, \u201Cand it is bad for
    a\r\nfool to be rich. A rich fool will think of nothing else at first but to\r\nfind
    a dark house wherein to hide away, and there he will satisfy his\r\nhunger, and
    he will continue to do that until his hunger is dead and\r\nhe is no better than
    dead but a wise person who is rich will carefully\r\npreserve his appetite. All
    people who have been rich for a long time, or\r\nwho are rich from birth, live
    a great deal outside of their houses, and\r\nso they are always hungry and healthy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPoor
    people have no time to be wise,\u201D said Caitilin.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey have time
    to be hungry,\u201D said Pan. \u201CI ask no more of them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    father is very wise,\u201D said Seumas Beg.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know that,
    little boy?\u201D said Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause he is always talking,\u201D
    replied Seumas. \u201CDo you always listen,\r\nmy dear?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,
    sir,\u201D said Seumas; \u201CI go to sleep when he talks.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    is very clever of you,\u201D said Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CI go to sleep too,\u201D
    said Brigid.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is clever of you also, my darling. Do you go to
    sleep when your\r\nmother talks?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, no,\u201D she answered.
    \u201CIf we went to sleep then our mother would pinch\r\nus and say that we were
    a bad breed.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think your mother is wise,\u201D said Pan.
    \u201CWhat do you like best in the\r\nworld, Seumas Beg?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe boy
    thought for a moment and replied: \u201CI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201D\r\n\r\nPan
    also thought for a little time.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what I like best
    either,\u201D said he. \u201CWhat do you like best\r\nin the world, Shepherd
    Girl?\u201D\r\n\r\nCaitilin\u2019s eyes were fixed on his.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t
    know yet,\u201D she answered slowly.\r\n\r\n\u201CMay the gods keep you safe
    from that knowledge,\u201D said Pan gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy would you say that?\u201D
    she replied. \u201COne must find out all things,\r\nand when we find out a thing
    we know if it is good or bad.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is the beginning of knowledge,\u201D
    said Pan, \u201Cbut it is not the\r\nbeginning of wisdom.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    is the beginning of wisdom?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is carelessness,\u201D replied
    Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what is the end of wisdom?\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do not know,\u201D he answered, after a little pause.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it greater
    carelessness?\u201D she enquired.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not know, I do not know,\u201D
    said he sharply. \u201CI am tired of\r\ntalking,\u201D and, so saying, he turned
    his face away from them and lay down\r\non the couch.\r\n\r\nCaitilin in great
    concern hurried the children to the door of the cave\r\nand kissed them good-bye.\r\n\r\n\u201CPan
    is sick,\u201D said the boy gravely.\r\n\r\n\u201CI hope he will be well soon
    again,\u201D the girl murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, yes,\u201D said Caitilin, and
    she ran back quickly to her lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II. THE PHILOSOPHER\u2019S
    JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWHEN the children reached home they told
    the Philosopher-the result of\r\ntheir visit. He questioned them minutely as
    to the appearance of\r\nPan, how he had received them, and what he had said in
    defence of his\r\niniquities; but when he found that Pan had not returned any
    answer\r\nto his message he became very angry. He tried to persuade his wife
    to\r\nundertake another embassy setting forth his abhorrence and defiance of\r\nthe
    god, but the Thin Woman replied sourly that she was a respectable\r\nmarried
    woman, that having been already bereaved of her wisdom she had\r\nno desire to
    be further curtailed of her virtue, that a husband would go\r\nany length to
    asperse his wife\u2019s reputation, and that although she was\r\nmarried to a
    fool her self-respect had survived even that calamity. The\r\nPhilosopher pointed
    out that her age, her appearance, and her tongue\r\nwere sufficient guarantees
    of immunity against the machinations of\r\neither Pan or slander, and that he
    had no personal feelings in the\r\nmatter beyond a scientific and benevolent
    interest in the troubles\r\nof Meehawl MacMurrachu; but this was discounted by
    his wife as the\r\nmalignant and subtle tactics customary to all husbands.\r\n\r\nMatters
    appeared to be thus at a deadlock so far as they were\r\nimmediately concerned,
    and the Philosopher decided that he would lay the\r\ncase before Angus Og and
    implore his protection and assistance on behalf\r\nof the Clann MacMurrachu.
    He therefore directed the Thin Woman to bake\r\nhim two cakes of bread, and set
    about preparations for a journey.\r\n\r\nThe Thin Woman baked the cakes, and
    put them in a bag, and early on the\r\nfollowing morning the Philosopher swung
    this bag over his shoulder, and\r\nwent forth on his quest.\r\n\r\nWhen he came
    to the edge of the pine wood he halted for a few moments,\r\nnot being quite
    certain of his bearings, and then went forward again in\r\nthe direction of Gort
    na Cloca Mora. It came into his mind as he crossed\r\nthe Gort that he ought
    to call on the Leprecauns and have a talk with\r\nthem, but a remembrance of
    Meehawl MacMurrachu and the troubles under\r\nwhich he laboured (all directly
    to be traced to the Leprecauns) hardened\r\nhis heart against his neighbours,
    so that he passed by the yew tree\r\nwithout any stay. In a short time he came
    to the rough, heather-clumped\r\nfield wherein the children had found Pan, and
    as he was proceeding up\r\nthe hill, he saw Caitilin Ni Murrachu walking a little
    way in front with\r\na small vessel in her hand. The she-goat which she had just
    milked was\r\nbending again to the herbage, and as Caitilin trod lightly in front
    of\r\nhim the Philosopher closed his eyes in virtuous anger and opened them\r\nagain
    in a not unnatural curiosity, for the girl had no clothes on. He\r\nwatched her
    going behind the brush and disappearing in the cleft of the\r\nrock, and his
    anger, both with her and Pan, mastering him he forsook\r\nthe path of prudence
    which soared to the mountain top, and followed that\r\nleading to the cave. The
    sound of his feet brought Caitilin out hastily,\r\nbut he pushed her by with
    a harsh word. \u201CHussy,\u201D said he, and he went\r\ninto the cave where
    Pan was.\r\n\r\nAs he went in he already repented of his harshness and said \u201CThe\r\nhuman
    body is an aggregation of flesh and sinew, around a central bony\r\nstructure.
    The use of clothing is primarily to protect this organism\r\nfrom rain and cold,
    and it may not be regarded as the banner of morality\r\nwithout danger to this
    fundamental premise. If a person does not desire\r\nto be so protected who will
    quarrel with an honourable liberty? Decency\r\nis not clothing but Mind. Morality
    is behaviour. Virtue is thought; I\r\nhave often fancied,\u201D he continued
    to Pan, whom he was now confronting,\r\n\u201Cthat the effect of clothing on
    mind must be very considerable, and that\r\nit must have a modifying rather than
    an expanding effect, or, even, an\r\nintensifying as against an exuberant effect.
    With clothing the whole\r\nenvironment is immediately affected. The air, which
    is our proper\r\nmedium, is only filtered to our bodies in an abated and niggardly\r\nfashion
    which can scarcely be as beneficial as the generous and\r\nunintermitted elemental
    play. The question naturally arises whether\r\nclothing is as unknown to nature
    as we have fancied? Viewed as a\r\nprotective measure against atmospheric rigour
    we find that many\r\ncreatures grow, by their own central impulse, some kind
    of exterior\r\npanoply which may be regarded as their proper clothing. Bears,
    cats,\r\ndogs, mice, sheep and beavers are wrapped in fur, hair, fell, fleece
    or\r\npelt, so these creatures cannot by any means be regarded as being naked.\r\nCrabs,
    cockroaches, snails and cockles have ordered around them a crusty\r\nhabiliment,
    wherein their original nakedness is only to be discovered by\r\nforce, and other
    creatures have similarly provided themselves with\r\nsome species of covering.
    Clothing, therefore, is not an art, but an\r\ninstinct, and the fact that man
    is born naked and does not grow his\r\nclothing upon himself from within but
    collects it from various distant\r\nand haphazard sources is not any reason to
    call this necessity an\r\ninstinct for decency. These, you will admit, are weighty
    reflections and\r\nworthy of consideration before we proceed to the wide and
    thorny subject\r\nof moral and immoral action. Now, what is virtue?\u201D Pan,
    who had listened\r\nwith great courtesy to these remarks, here broke in on the
    Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CVirtue,\u201D said he, \u201Cis the performance of
    pleasant actions.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher held the statement for a moment
    on his forefinger.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what, then, is vice?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is vicious,\u201D said Pan, \u201Cto neglect the performance of pleasant\r\nactions.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf
    this be so,\u201D the other commented, \u201Cphilosophy has up to the present\r\nbeen
    on the wrong track.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is so,\u201D said Pan. \u201CPhilosophy
    is an immoral practice because it\r\nsuggests a standard of practice impossible
    of being followed, and which,\r\nif it could be followed, would lead to the great
    sin of sterility.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe idea of virtue,\u201D said the Philosopher,
    with some indignation, \u201Chas\r\nanimated the noblest intellects of the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    has not animated them,\u201D replied Pan; \u201Cit has hypnotised them so\r\nthat
    they have conceived virtue as repression and self-sacrifice as an\r\nhonourable
    thing instead of the suicide which it is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D said
    the Philosopher; \u201Cthis is very interesting, and if it is\r\ntrue the whole
    conduct of life will have to be very much simplified.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLife
    is already very simple,\u201D said Pan; \u201Cit is to be born and to die,\r\nand
    in the interval to eat and drink, to dance and sing, to marry and\r\nbeget children.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    it is simply materialism,\u201D cried the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy do you
    say \u2018but\u2019?\u201D replied Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is sheer, unredeemed
    animalism,\u201D continued his visitor.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is any name you please
    to call it,\u201D replied Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou have proved nothing,\u201D the
    Philosopher shouted.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat can be sensed requires no proof.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    leave out the new thing,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CYou leave out\r\nbrains.
    I believe in mind above matter. Thought above emotion. Spirit\r\nabove flesh.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf
    course you do,\u201D said Pan, and he reached for his oaten pipe.\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher ran to the opening of the passage and thrust Caitilin\r\naside. \u201CHussy,\u201D
    said he fiercely to her, and he darted out.\r\n\r\nAs he went up the rugged path
    he could hear the pipes of Pan, calling\r\nand sobbing and making high merriment
    on the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\u201CSHE does not deserve to be
    rescued,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cbut I will\r\nrescue her. Indeed,\u201D
    he thought a moment later, \u201Cshe does not want to be\r\nrescued, and, therefore,
    I will rescue her.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs he went down the road her shapely figure floated
    before his eyes as\r\nbeautiful and simple as an old statue. He wagged his head
    angrily at the\r\napparition, but it would not go away. He tried to concentrate
    his mind\r\non a deep, philosophical maxim, but her disturbing image came between\r\nhim
    and his thought, blotting out the latter so completely that a moment\r\nafter
    he had stated his aphorism he could not remember what it had been.\r\nSuch a
    condition of mind was so unusual that it bewildered him.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs a mind,
    then, so unstable,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat a mere figure, an\r\nanimated geometrical
    arrangement can shake it from its foundations?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe idea horrified
    him: he saw civilisation building its temples over a\r\nvolcano...\r\n\r\n\u201CA
    puff,\u201D said he, \u201Cand it is gone. Beneath all is chaos and red\r\nanarchy,
    over all a devouring and insistent appetite. Our eyes tell\r\nus what to think
    about, and our wisdom is no more than a catalogue of\r\nsensual stimuli.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    would have been in a state of deep dejection were it not that through\r\nhis
    perturbation there bubbled a stream of such amazing well-being as he\r\nhad not
    felt since childhood. Years had toppled from his shoulders. He\r\nleft one pound
    of solid matter behind at every stride. His very skin\r\ngrew flexuous, and he
    found a pleasure in taking long steps such as he\r\ncould not have accounted
    for by thought. Indeed, thought was the one\r\nthing he felt unequal to, and
    it was not precisely that he could not\r\nthink but that he did not want to.
    All the importance and authority\r\nof his mind seemed to have faded away, and
    the activity which had\r\nonce belonged to that organ was now transferred to
    his eyes. He saw,\r\namazedly, the sunshine bathing the hills and the valleys.
    A bird in\r\nthe hedge held him--beak, head, eyes, legs, and the wings that tapered\r\nwidely
    at angles to the wind. For the first time in his life he really\r\nsaw a bird,
    and one minute after it had flown away he could have\r\nreproduced its strident
    note. With every step along the curving road\r\nthe landscape was changing. He
    saw and noted it almost in an ecstasy. A\r\nsharp hill jutted out into the road,
    it dissolved into a sloping meadow,\r\nrolled down into a valley and then climbed
    easily and peacefully into\r\na hill again. On this side a clump of trees nodded
    together in the\r\nfriendliest fashion. Yonder a solitary tree, well-grown and
    clean, was\r\ncontented with its own bright company. A bush crouched tightly
    on the\r\nground as though, at a word, it would scamper from its place and chase\r\nrabbits
    across the sward with shouts and laughter. Great spaces of\r\nsunshine were everywhere,
    and everywhere there were deep wells of\r\nshadow; and the one did not seem more
    beautiful than the other. That\r\nsunshine! Oh, the glory of it, the goodness
    and bravery of it, how\r\nbroadly and grandly it shone, without stint, without
    care; he saw its\r\nmeasureless generosity and gloried in it as though himself
    had been the\r\nflinger of that largesse. And was he not? Did the sunlight not
    stream\r\nfrom his head and life from his finger-tips? Surely the well-being
    that\r\nwas in him did bubble out to an activity beyond the universe. Thought!\r\nOh!
    the petty thing! but motion! emotion! these were the realities. To\r\nfeel, to
    do, to stride forward in elation chanting a paean of triumphant\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nAfter
    a time he felt hungry, and thrusting his hand into his wallet he\r\nbroke off
    a piece of one of his cakes and looked about for a place where\r\nhe might happily
    eat it. By the side of the road there was a well; just\r\na little corner filled
    with water. Over it was a rough stone coping, and\r\naround, hugging it on three
    sides almost from sight, were thick, quiet\r\nbushes. He would not have noticed
    the well at all but for a thin stream,\r\nthe breadth of two hands, which tiptoed
    away from it through a field.\r\nBy this well he sat down and scooped the water
    in his hand and it tasted\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nHe was eating his cake when a sound
    touched his ear from some distance,\r\nand shortly a woman came down the path
    carrying a vessel in her hand to\r\ndraw water.\r\n\r\nShe was a big, comely
    woman, and she walked as one who had no\r\nmisfortunes and no misgivings. When
    she saw the Philosopher sitting by\r\nthe well she halted a moment in surprise
    and then came forward with a\r\ngood-humoured smile.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morrow
    to you, sir,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morrow to you too, ma\u2019am,\u201D
    replied the Philosopher. \u201CSit down\r\nbeside me here and eat some of my
    cake.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy wouldn\u2019t I, indeed,\u201D said the woman, and
    she did sit beside him.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher cracked a large piece off his
    cake and gave it to her\r\nand she ate some.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a taste
    on that cake,\u201D said she. \u201CWho made it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy wife did,\u201D
    he replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, now!\u201D said she, looking at him. \u201CDo
    you know, you don\u2019t look a\r\nbit like a married man.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo?\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot a bit. A married man looks comfortable
    and settled: he looks\r\nfinished, if you understand me, and a bachelor looks
    unsettled and\r\nfunny, and he always wants to be running round seeing things.
    I\u2019d know a\r\nmarried man from a bachelor any day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow
    would you know that?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CEasily,\u201D said
    she, with a nod. \u201CIt\u2019s the way they look at a woman.\r\nA married man
    looks at you quietly as if he knew all about you. There\r\nisn\u2019t any strangeness
    about him with a woman at all; but a bachelor man\r\nlooks at you very sharp
    and looks away and then looks back again, the\r\nway you\u2019d know he was thinking
    about you and didn\u2019t know what you were\r\nthinking about him; and so they
    are always strange, and that\u2019s why women\r\nlike them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy!\u201D
    said the Philosopher, astonished, \u201Cdo women like bachelors better\r\nthan
    married men?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course they do,\u201D she replied heartily.
    \u201CThey wouldn\u2019t look at the\r\nside of the road a married man was on
    if there was a bachelor man on the\r\nother side.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThis,\u201D
    said the Philosopher earnestly, \u201Cis very interesting.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    the queer thing is,\u201D she continued, \u201Cthat when I came up the road\r\nand
    saw you I said to myself \u2018it\u2019s a bachelor man.\u2019 How long have
    you\r\nbeen married, now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D said the
    Philosopher. \u201CMaybe it\u2019s ten years.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how many
    children would you have, mister?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTwo,\u201D he replied, and
    then corrected himself, \u201CNo, I have only one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs the
    other one dead?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never had more than one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTen
    years married and only one child,\u201D said she. \u201CWhy, man dear, you\u2019re\r\nnot
    a married man. What were you doing at all, at all! I wouldn\u2019t like\r\nto
    be telling you the children I have living and dead. But what I say is\r\nthat
    married or not you\u2019re a bachelor man. I knew it the minute I looked\r\nat
    you. What sort of a woman is herself?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s a thin sort
    of woman,\u201D cried the Philosopher, biting into his\r\ncake.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    she now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd,\u201D the Philosopher continued, \u201Cthe reason
    I talked to you is because\r\nyou are a fat woman.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not
    fat,\u201D was her angry response.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are fat,\u201D insisted the
    Philosopher, \u201Cand that\u2019s the reason I like\r\nyou.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh,
    if you mean it that way...\u201D she chuckled.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think,\u201D he
    continued, looking at her admiringly, \u201Cthat women ought to\r\nbe fat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell
    you the truth,\u201D said she eagerly, \u201CI think that myself. I never\r\nmet
    a thin woman but she was a sour one, and I never met a fat man but\r\nhe was
    a fool. Fat women and thin men; it\u2019s nature,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is,\u201D said he, and he leaned forward and kissed her eye.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,
    you villain!\u201D said the woman, putting out her hands against him.\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher drew back abashed. \u201CForgive me,\u201D he began, \u201Cif I have\r\nalarmed
    your virtue--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the married man\u2019s word,\u201D
    said she, rising hastily: \u201Cnow I know\r\nyou; but there\u2019s a lot of
    the bachelor in you all the same, God help\r\nyou! I\u2019m going home.\u201D
    And, so saying, she dipped her vessel in the well\r\nand turned away.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, \u201CI ought to wait until your husband comes\r\nhome
    and ask his forgiveness for the wrong I\u2019ve done him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe woman
    turned round on him and each of her eyes was as big as a\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    do you say?\u201D said she. \u201CFollow me if you dare and I\u2019ll set the
    dog\r\non you; I will so,\u201D and she strode viciously homewards.\r\n\r\nAfter
    a moment\u2019s hesitation the Philosopher took his own path across the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nThe
    day was now well advanced, and as he trudged forward the happy\r\nquietude of
    his surroundings stole into his heart again and so toned\r\ndown his recollection
    of the fat woman that in a little time she was\r\nno more than a pleasant and
    curious memory. His mind was exercised\r\nsuperficially, not in thinking, but
    in wondering how it was he had come\r\nto kiss a strange woman. He said to himself
    that such conduct was not\r\nright; but this statement was no more than the automatic
    working of a\r\nmind long exercised in the distinctions of right and wrong, for,
    almost\r\nin the same breath, he assured himself that what he had done did not\r\nmatter
    in the least. His opinions were undergoing a curious change.\r\nRight and wrong
    were meeting and blending together so closely that it\r\nbecame difficult to
    dissever them, and the obloquy attaching to the one\r\nseemed out of proportion
    altogether to its importance, while the other\r\nby no means justified the eulogy
    wherewith it was connected. Was there\r\nany immediate or even distant, effect
    on life caused by evil which\r\nwas not instantly swung into equipoise by goodness?
    But these slender\r\nreflections troubled him only for a little time. He had
    little desire\r\nfor any introspective quarryings. To feel so well was sufficient
    in\r\nitself. Why should thought be so apparent to us, so insistent? We do\r\nnot
    know we have digestive or circulatory organs until these go out of\r\norder,
    and then the knowledge torments us. Should not the labours of a\r\nhealthy brain
    be equally subterranean and equally competent? Why have we\r\nto think aloud
    and travel laboriously from syllogism to ergo, chary of\r\nour conclusions and
    distrustful of our premises? Thought, as we know\r\nit, is a disease and no more.
    The healthy mentality should register its\r\nconvictions and not its labours.
    Our ears should not hear the clamour of\r\nits doubts nor be forced to listen
    to the pro and con wherewith we are\r\neternally badgered and perplexed.\r\n\r\nThe
    road was winding like a ribbon in and out of the mountains. On\r\neither side
    there were hedges and bushes,--little, stiff trees which\r\nheld their foliage
    in their hands and dared the winds snatch a leaf from\r\nthat grip. The hills
    were swelling and sinking, folding and soaring\r\non every view. Now the silence
    was startled by the falling tinkle of a\r\nstream. Far away a cow lowed, a long,
    deep monotone, or a goat\u2019s call\r\ntrembled from nowhere to nowhere. But
    mostly there was a silence which\r\nbuzzed with a multitude of small winged life.
    Going up the hills the\r\nPhilosopher bent forward to the gradient, stamping
    vigorously as he\r\ntrod, almost snorting like a bull in the pride of successful
    energy.\r\nComing down the slope he braced back and let his legs loose to do
    as\r\nthey pleased. Didn\u2019t they know their business--Good luck to them,
    and\r\naway!\r\n\r\nAs he walked along he saw an old woman hobbling in front
    of him. She was\r\nleaning on a stick and her hand was red and swollen with rheumatism.
    She\r\nhobbled by reason of the fact that there were stones in her shapeless\r\nboots.
    She was draped in the sorriest miscellaneous rags that could\r\nbe imagined,
    and these were knotted together so intricately that her\r\nclothing, having once
    been attached to her body, could never again\r\nbe detached from it. As she walked
    she was mumbling and grumbling to\r\nherself, so that her mouth moved round and
    round in an india-rubber\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher soon caught up on
    her.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morrow, ma\u2019am,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nBut she did
    not hear him: she seemed to be listening to the pain which\r\nthe stones in her
    boots gave her.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morrow, ma\u2019am,\u201D said the Philosopher
    again.\r\n\r\nThis time she heard him and replied, turning her old, bleared eyes\r\nslowly
    in his direction-\u201CGood morrow to yourself, sir,\u201D said she, and\r\nthe
    Philosopher thought her old face was a very kindly one.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is
    it that is wrong with you, ma\u2019am?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    my boots, sir,\u201D she replied. \u201CFull of stones they are, the way I\r\ncan
    hardly walk at all, God help me!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you shake
    them out?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, sure, I couldn\u2019t be bothered, sir, for
    there are so many holes in\r\nthe boots that more would get in before I could
    take two steps, and an\r\nold woman can\u2019t be always fidgeting, God help
    her!\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a little house on one side of the road, and when
    the old woman\r\nsaw this place she brightened up a little.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you
    know who lives in that house?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not,\u201D
    she replied, \u201Cbut it\u2019s a real nice house with clean windows\r\nand
    a shiny knocker on the door, and smoke in the chimney--I wonder\r\nwould herself
    give me a cup of tea now if I asked her--A poor old\r\nwoman walking the roads
    on a stick! and maybe a bit of meat, or an egg\r\nperhaps....\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    could ask,\u201D suggested the Philosopher gently.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe I will,
    too,\u201D said she, and she sat down by the road just outside\r\nthe house and
    the Philosopher also sat down.\r\n\r\nA little puppy dog came from behind the
    house and approached them\r\ncautiously. Its intentions were friendly but it
    had already found that\r\namicable advances are sometimes indifferently received,
    for, as it drew\r\nnear, it wagged its dubious tail and rolled humbly on the
    ground. But\r\nvery soon the dog discovered that here there was no evil, for
    it trotted\r\nover to the old woman, and without any more preparation jumped
    into her\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nThe old woman grinned at the dog \u201CAh, you thing
    you!\u201D said she, and she\r\ngave it her finger to bite. The delighted puppy
    chewed her bony\r\nfinger, and then instituted a mimic warfare against a piece
    of rag that\r\nfluttered from her breast, barking and growling in joyous excitement,\r\nwhile
    the old woman fondled and hugged it.\r\n\r\nThe door of the house opposite opened
    quickly, and a woman with a\r\nfrost-bitten face came out.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeave
    that dog down,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\nThe old woman grinned humbly at her.\r\n\r\n\u201CSure,
    ma\u2019am, I wouldn\u2019t hurt the little dog, the thing!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPut
    down that dog,\u201D said the woman, \u201Cand go about your business--the\r\nlikes
    of you ought to be arrested.\u201D\r\n\r\nA man in shirt sleeves appeared behind
    her, and at him the old woman\r\ngrinned even more humbly.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet me
    sit here for a while and play with the little dog, sir,\u201D said\r\nshe; \u201Csure
    the roads do be lonesome--\u201D\r\n\r\nThe man stalked close and grabbed the
    dog by the scruff of the neck. It\r\nhung between his finger and thumb with its
    tail tucked between its legs\r\nand its eyes screwed round on one side in amazement.\r\n\r\n\u201CBe
    off with you out of that, you old strap!\u201D said the man in a terrible\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nSo
    the old woman rose painfully to her feet again, and as she went\r\nhobbling along
    the dusty road she began to cry.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher also arose; he was very
    indignant but did not know what\r\nto do. A singular lassitude also prevented
    him from interfering. As they\r\npaced along his companion began mumbling, more
    to herself than to him\r\n\u201CAh, God be with me,\u201D said she, \u201Can
    old woman on a stick, that hasn\u2019t\r\na place in the wide world to go to
    or a neighbour itself.... I wish\r\nI could get a cup of tea, so I do. I wish
    to God I could get a cup\r\nof tea.... Me sitting down in my own little house,
    with the white\r\ntablecloth on the table, and the butter in the dish, and the
    strong, red\r\ntea in the tea-cup; and me pouring cream into it, and, maybe,
    telling\r\nthe children not to be wasting the sugar, the things! and himself
    saying\r\nhe\u2019d got to mow the big field to-day, or that the red cow was
    going\r\nto calve, the poor thing, and that if the boys went to school, who was\r\ngoing
    to weed the turnips--and me sitting drinking my strong cup of tea,\r\nand telling
    him where that old trapesing hen was laying.... Ah, God be\r\nwith me! an old
    creature hobbling along the roads on a stick. I wish I\r\nwas a young girl again,
    so I do, and himself coming courting me, and him\r\nsaying that I was a real
    nice little girl surely, and that nothing would\r\nmake him happy or easy at
    all but me to be loving him.--Ah, the kind man\r\nthat he was, to be sure, the
    kind, decent man.... And Sorca Reilly to be\r\ntrying to get him from me, and
    Kate Finnegan with her bold eyes looking\r\nafter him in the Chapel; and him
    to be saying that along with me they\r\nwere only a pair of old nanny goats....
    And then me to be getting\r\nmarried and going home to my own little house with
    my man--ah, God be\r\nwith me! and him kissing me, and laughing, and frightening
    me with his\r\ngoings-on. Ah, the kind man, with his soft eyes, and his nice
    voice, and\r\nhis jokes and laughing, and him thinking the world and all of me--ay,\r\nindeed....
    And the neighbours to be coming in and sitting round the fire\r\nin the night
    time, putting the world through each other, and talking\r\nabout France and Russia
    and them other queer places, and him holding\r\nup the discourse like a learned
    man, and them all listening to him and\r\nnodding their heads at each other,
    and wondering at his education and\r\nall: or, maybe, the neighbours to be singing,
    or him making me sing the\r\nCoulin, and him to be proud of me... and then him
    to be killed on me\r\nwith a cold on his chest. ... Ah, then, God be with me,
    a lone,\r\nold creature on a stick, and the sun shining into her eyes and she\r\nthirsty--I
    wish I had a cup of tea, so I do. I wish to God I had a cup\r\nof tea and a bit
    of meat... or, maybe, an egg. A nice fresh egg laid\r\nby the speckeldy hen that
    used to be giving me all the trouble, the\r\nthing!... Sixteen hens I had, and
    they were the ones for laying,\r\nsurely.... It\u2019s the queer world, so it
    is, the queer world--and the\r\nthings that do happen for no reason at all....
    Ah, God be with me! I\r\nwish there weren\u2019t stones in my boots, so I do,
    and I wish to God I had\r\na cup of tea and a fresh egg. Ah, glory be, my old
    legs are getting\r\ntireder every day, so they are. Wisha, one time--when himself
    was in\r\nit--I could go about the house all day long, cleaning the place, and\r\nfeeding
    the pigs, and the hens and all, and then dance half the night,\r\nso I could:
    and himself proud of me....\u201D\r\n\r\nThe old woman turned up a little rambling
    road and went on still talking\r\nto herself, and the Philosopher watched her
    go up that road for a long\r\ntime. He was very glad she had gone away, and as
    he tramped forward he\r\nbanished her sad image so that in a little time he was
    happy again. The\r\nsun was still shining, the birds were flying on every side,
    and the wide\r\nhill-side above him smiled gaily.\r\n\r\nA small, narrow road
    cut at right angles into his path, and as he\r\napproached this he heard the
    bustle and movement of a host, the trample\r\nof feet, the rolling and creaking
    of wheels, and the long unwearied\r\ndrone of voices. In a few minutes he came
    abreast of this small road,\r\nand saw an ass and cart piled with pots and pans,
    and walking beside\r\nthis there were two men and a woman. The men and the woman
    were talking\r\ntogether loudly, even fiercely, and the ass was drawing his cart
    along\r\nthe road without requiring assistance or direction. While there was
    a\r\nroad he walked on it: when he might come to a cross road he would turn\r\nto
    the right: when a man said \u201Cwhoh\u201D he would stop: when he said \u201Chike\u201D\r\nhe
    would go backwards, and when he said \u201Cyep\u201D he would go on again. That\r\nwas
    life, and if one questioned it, one was hit with a stick, or a boot,\r\nor a
    lump of rock: if one continued walking nothing happened, and that\r\nwas happiness.\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher saluted this cavalcade.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod be with you,\u201D said
    he.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod and Mary be with you,\u201D said the first man.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod,
    and Mary, and Patrick be with you,\u201D said the second man.\r\n\r\n\u201CGod,
    and Mary, and Patrick, and Brigid be with you,\u201D said the woman.\r\n\r\nThe
    ass, however, did not say a thing. As the word \u201Cwhoh\u201D had not\r\nentered
    into the conversation he knew it was none of his business, and\r\nso he turned
    to the right on the new path and continued his journey.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere are
    you going to, stranger,\u201D said the first man.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am going to
    visit Angus Og,\u201D replied the Philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe man gave him a quick
    look.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D said he, \u201Cthat\u2019s the queerest story
    I ever heard. Listen here,\u201D\r\n he called to the others, \u201Cthis man
    is looking for Angus Og.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other man and woman came closer.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    would you be wanting with Angus Og, Mister Honey?\u201D said the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D
    replied the Philosopher, \u201Cit\u2019s a particular thing, a family\r\nmatter.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere
    was silence for a few minutes, and they all stepped onwards behind\r\nthe ass
    and cart.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know where to look for himself?\u201D said
    the first man again:\r\n\u201Cmaybe you got the place where he lives written
    down in an old book or\r\non a carved stone?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COr did you find
    the staff of Amergin or of Ossian in a bog and it\r\nwritten from the top to
    the bottom with signs?\u201D said the second man.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said
    the Philosopher, \u201Cit isn\u2019t that way you\u2019d go visiting a god.\r\nWhat
    you do is, you go out from your house and walk straight away in\r\nany direction
    with your shadow behind you so long as it is towards a\r\nmountain, for the gods
    will not stay in a valley or a level plain, but\r\nonly in high places; and then,
    if the god wants you to see him, you will\r\ngo to his rath as direct as if you
    knew where it was, for he will be\r\nleading you with an airy thread reaching
    from his own place to wherever\r\nyou are, and if he doesn\u2019t want to see
    you, you will never find out\r\nwhere he is, not if you were to walk for a year
    or twenty years.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know he wants to see you?\u201D
    said the second man.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy wouldn\u2019t he want?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe,
    Mister Honey,\u201D said the woman, \u201Cyou are a holy sort of a man\r\nthat
    a god would like well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy would I be that?\u201D said the
    Philosopher. \u201CThe gods like a man\r\nwhether he\u2019s holy or not if he\u2019s
    only decent.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, well, there\u2019s plenty of that sort,\u201D
    said the first man. \u201CWhat do\r\nyou happen to have in your bag, stranger?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D
    replied the Philosopher, \u201Cbut a cake and a half that was\r\nbaked for my
    journey.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me a bit of your cake, Mister Honey,\u201D said
    the woman. \u201CI like to\r\nhave a taste of everybody\u2019s cake.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will, and welcome,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may as well give
    us all a bit while you are about it,\u201D said the\r\nsecond man. \u201CThat
    woman hasn\u2019t got all the hunger of the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, and he divided the cake.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a sup
    of water up yonder,\u201D said the first man, \u201Cand it will do\r\nto moisten
    the cake--Whoh, you devil,\u201D he roared at the ass, and the ass\r\nstood stock
    still on the minute.\r\n\r\nThere was a thin fringe of grass along the road near
    a wall, and towards\r\nthis the ass began to edge very gently.\r\n\r\n\u201CHike,
    you beast, you,\u201D shouted the man, and the ass at once hiked, but\r\nhe did
    it in a way that brought him close to the grass. The first man\r\ntook a tin
    can out of the cart and climbed over the little wall for\r\nwater. Before he
    went he gave the ass three kicks on the nose, but\r\nthe ass did not say a word,
    he only hiked still more which brought him\r\ndirectly on to the grass, and when
    the man climbed over the wall the ass\r\ncommenced to crop the grass. There was
    a spider sitting on a hot stone\r\nin the grass. He had a small body and wide
    legs, and he wasn\u2019t doing\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes anybody ever kick
    you in the nose?\u201D said the ass to him.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy does there,\u201D
    said the spider; \u201Cyou and your like that are always\r\nwalking on me, or
    lying down on me, or running over me with the wheels\r\nof a cart.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,
    why don\u2019t you stay on the wall?\u201D said the ass.\r\n\r\n\u201CSure, my
    wife is there,\u201D replied the spider.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the harm in
    that?\u201D said the ass.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019d eat me,\u201D said the spider,
    \u201Cand, anyhow, the competition on the\r\nwall is dreadful, and the flies
    are getting wiser and timider every\r\nseason. Have you got a wife yourself,
    now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not,\u201D said the ass; \u201CI wish I had.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    like your wife for the first while,\u201D said the spider, \u201Cand after\r\nthat
    you hate her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I had the first while I\u2019d chance the
    second while,\u201D replied the ass.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s bachelor\u2019s talk,\u201D
    said the spider; \u201Call the same, we can\u2019t keep\r\naway from them,\u201D
    and so saying he began to move all his legs at once in\r\nthe direction of the
    wall. \u201CYou can only die once,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf your wife was
    an ass she wouldn\u2019t eat you,\u201D said the ass.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019d
    be doing something else then,\u201D replied the spider, and he climbed\r\nup
    the wall.\r\n\r\nThe first man came back with the can of water and they sat down
    on the\r\ngrass and ate the cake and drank the water. All the time the woman
    kept\r\nher eyes fixed on the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CMister Honey,\u201D said
    she, \u201CI think you met us just at the right moment.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe other
    two men sat upright and looked at each other and then with\r\nequal intentness
    they looked at the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy do you say that?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    were having a great argument along the road, and if we were to\r\nbe talking
    from now to the dav of doom that argument would never be\r\nfinished.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    must have been a great argument. Was it about predestination or\r\nwhere consciousness
    comes from?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was not; it was which of these two men was
    to marry me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s not a great argument,\u201D said
    the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CIsn\u2019t it,\u201D said the woman. \u201CFor
    seven days and six nights we didn\u2019t\r\ntalk about anything else, and that\u2019s
    a great argument or I\u2019d like to\r\nknow what is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    where is the trouble, ma\u2019am?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    this,\u201D she replied, \u201Cthat I can\u2019t make up my mind which of the
    men\r\nI\u2019ll take, for I like one as well as the other and better, and I\u2019d
    as\r\nsoon have one as the other and rather.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a hard
    case,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is,\u201D said the woman, \u201Cand
    I\u2019m sick and sorry with the trouble of\r\nit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd why
    did you say that I had come up in a good minute?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause,
    Mister Honey, when a woman has two men to choose from she\r\ndoesn\u2019t know
    what to do, for two men always become like brothers so\r\nthat you wouldn\u2019t
    know which of them was which: there isn\u2019t any more\r\ndifference between
    two men than there is between a couple of hares. But\r\nwhen there\u2019s three
    men to choose from, there\u2019s no trouble at all; and so\r\nI say that it\u2019s
    yourself I\u2019ll marry this night and no one else--and let\r\nyou two men be
    sitting quiet in your places, for I\u2019m telling you what\r\nI\u2019ll do and
    that\u2019s the end of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll give you my word,\u201D
    said the first man, \u201Cthat I\u2019m just as glad as\r\nyou are to have it
    over and done with.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMoidered I was,\u201D said the second
    man, \u201Cwith the whole argument, and the\r\nthis and that of it, and you not
    able to say a word but--maybe I will\r\nand maybe I won\u2019t, and this is true
    and that is true, and why not to me\r\nand why not to him--I\u2019ll get a sleep
    this night.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher was perplexed.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou cannot
    marry me, ma\u2019am,\u201D said he, \u201Cbecause I\u2019m married already.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    woman turned round on him angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be making any argument
    with me now,\u201D said she, \u201Cfor I won\u2019t stand\r\nit.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    first man looked fiercely at the Philosopher, and then motioned to\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive
    that man a clout in the jaw,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nThe second man was preparing
    to do this when the woman intervened\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep your hands
    to yourself,\u201D said she, \u201Cor it\u2019ll be the worse for you.\r\nI\u2019m
    well able to take care of my own husband,\u201D and she drew nearer and\r\nsat
    between the Philosopher and the men.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the Philosopher\u2019s
    cake lost all its savour, and he packed\r\nthe remnant into his wallet. They
    all sat silently looking at their feet\r\nand thinking each one according to
    his nature. The Philosopher\u2019s mind,\r\nwhich for the past day had been in
    eclipse, stirred faintly to meet\r\nthese new circumstances, but without much
    result. There was a flutter at\r\nhis heart which was terrifying, but not unpleasant.
    Quickening through\r\nhis apprehension was an expectancy which stirred his pulses
    into speed.\r\nSo rapidly did his blood flow, so quickly were an hundred impressions\r\nvisualized
    and recorded, so violent was the surface movement of his\r\nbrain that he did
    not realize he was unable to think and that he was\r\nonly seeing and feeling.\r\n\r\nThe
    first man stood up.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe night will be coming on soon,\u201D said
    he, \u201Cand we had better be\r\nwalking on if we want to get a good place to
    sleep. Yep, you devil,\u201D he\r\nroared at the ass, and the ass began to move
    almost before he lifted his\r\nhead from the grass. The two men walked one on
    either side of the cart,\r\nand the woman and the Philosopher walked behind at
    the tail-board.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you were feeling tired, or anything like that,
    Mister Honey,\u201D said\r\nthe woman, \u201Cyou could climb up into the little
    cart, and nobody would\r\nsay a word to you, for I can see that you are not used
    to travelling.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am not indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201D he replied;
    \u201Cthis is the first time I ever\r\ncame on a journey, and if it wasn\u2019t
    for Angus Og I wouldn\u2019t put a foot\r\nout of my own place for ever.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPut
    Angus Og out of your head, my dear,\u201D she replied, \u201Cfor what would\r\nthe
    likes of you and me be saying to a god. He might put a curse on us\r\nwould sink
    us into the ground or burn us up like a grip of straw. Be\r\ncontented now, I\u2019m
    saying, for if there is a woman in the world who\r\nknows all things I am that
    woman myself, and if you tell your trouble\r\nto me I\u2019ll tell you the thing
    to do just as good as Angus himself, and\r\nbetter perhaps.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    is very interesting,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CWhat kind of things\r\ndo
    you know best?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you were to ask one of them two men walking
    beside the ass they\u2019d\r\ntell you plenty of things they saw me do when they
    could do nothing\r\nthemselves. When there wasn\u2019t a road to take anywhere
    I showed them a\r\nroad, and when there wasn\u2019t a bit of food in the world
    I gave them food,\r\nand when they were bet to the last I put shillings in their
    hands, and\r\nthat\u2019s the reason they wanted to marry me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo
    you call that kind of thing wisdom?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    wouldn\u2019t I?\u201D said she. \u201CIsn\u2019t it wisdom to go through the
    world\r\nwithout fear and not to be hungry in a hungry hour?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    suppose it is,\u201D he replied, \u201Cbut I never thought of it that way\r\nmyself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    what would you call wisdom?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t rightly say now,\u201D
    he replied, \u201Cbut I think it was not to\r\nmind about the world, and not
    to care whether you were hungry or not,\r\nand not to live in the world at all
    but only in your own head, for the\r\nworld is a tyrannous place. You have to
    raise yourself above things\r\ninstead of letting things raise themselves above
    you. We must not be\r\nslaves to each other, and we must not be slaves to our
    necessities\r\neither. That is the problem of existence. There is no dignity
    in life at\r\nall if hunger can shout \u2018stop\u2019 at every turn of the road
    and the day\u2019s\r\njourney is measured by the distance between one sleep and
    the next\r\nsleep. Life is all slavery, and Nature is driving us with the whips
    of\r\nappetite and weariness; but when a slave rebels he ceases to be a slave,\r\nand
    when we are too hungry to live we can die and have our laugh. I\r\nbelieve that
    Nature is just as alive as we are, and that she is as\r\nmuch frightened of us
    as we are of her, and, mind you this, mankind has\r\ndeclared war against Nature
    and we will win. She does not understand\r\nyet that her geologic periods won\u2019t
    do any longer, and that while she is\r\npattering along the line of least resistance
    we are going to travel fast\r\nand far until we find her, and then, being a female,
    she is bound to\r\ngive in when she is challenged.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    good talk,\u201D said the woman, \u201Cbut it\u2019s foolishness. Women never\r\ngive
    in unless they get what they want, and where\u2019s the harm to them\r\nthen?
    You have to live in the world, my dear, whether you like it or\r\nnot, and, believe
    me now, that there isn\u2019t any wisdom but to keep clear\r\nof the hunger,
    for if that gets near enough it will make a hare of you.\r\nSure, listen to reason
    now like a good man. What is Nature at all but a\r\nword that learned men have
    made to talk about. There\u2019s clay and gods and\r\nmen, and they are good
    friends enough.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sun had long since gone down, and the grey evening
    was bowing over\r\nthe land, hiding the mountain peaks, and putting a shadow
    round the\r\nscattered bushes and the wide clumps of heather.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    know a place up here where we can stop for the night,\u201D said she, \u201Cand\r\nthere\u2019s
    a little shebeen round the bend of the road where we can get\r\nanything we want.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt
    the word \u201Cwhoh\u201D the ass stopped and one of the men took the harness\r\noff
    him. When he was unyoked the man gave him two kicks: \u201CBe off with\r\nyou,
    you devil, and see if you can get anything to eat,\u201D he roared.\r\nThe ass
    trotted a few paces off and searched about until he found\r\nsome grass. He ate
    this, and when he had eaten as much as he wanted he\r\nreturned and lay down
    under a wall. He lay for a long time looking in\r\nthe one direction, and at
    last he put his head down and went to sleep.\r\nWhile he was sleeping he kept
    one ear up and the other ear down for\r\nabout twenty minutes, and then he put
    the first ear down and the other\r\none up, and he kept on doing this all the
    night. If he had anything to\r\nlose you wouldn\u2019t mind him setting up sentries,
    but he hadn\u2019t a thing\r\nin the world except his skin and his bones, and
    no one would be bothered\r\nstealing them.\r\n\r\nOne of the men took a long
    bottle out of the cart and walked up the road\r\nwith it. The other man lifted
    out a tin bucket which was punched all\r\nover with jagged holes. Then he took
    out some sods of turf and lumps of\r\nwood and he put these in the bucket, and
    in a few minutes he had a very\r\nnice fire lit. A pot of water was put on to
    boil, and the woman cut up a\r\ngreat lump of bacon which she put into the pot.
    She had eight eggs in\r\na place in the cart, and a flat loaf of bread, and some
    cold boiled\r\npotatoes, and she spread her apron on the ground and arranged
    these\r\nthings on it.\r\n\r\nThe other man came down the road again with his
    big bottle filled with\r\nporter, and he put this in a safe place. Then they
    emptied everything\r\nout of the cart and hoisted it over the little wall. They
    turned the\r\ncart on one side and pulled it near to the fire, and they all sat
    inside\r\nthe cart and ate their supper. When supper was done they lit their\r\npipes,
    and the woman lit a pipe also. The bottle of porter was brought\r\nforward, and
    they took drinks in turn out of the bottle, and smoked\r\ntheir pipes, and talked.\r\n\r\nThere
    was no moon that night, and no stars, so that just beyond the fire\r\nthere was
    a thick darkness which one would not like to look at, it was\r\nso cold and empty.
    While talking they all kept their eyes fixed on the\r\nred fire, or watched the
    smoke from their pipes drifting and curling\r\naway against the blackness, and
    disappearing as suddenly as lightning.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder,\u201D said the
    first man, \u201Cwhat it was gave you the idea of\r\nmarrying this man instead
    of myself or my comrade, for we are young,\r\nhardy men, and he is getting old,
    God help him!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, indeed,\u201D said the second man; \u201Che\u2019s
    as grey as a badger, and\r\nthere\u2019s no flesh on his bones.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    have a right to ask that,\u201D said she, \u201Cand I\u2019ll tell you why I\r\ndidn\u2019t
    marry either of you. You are only a pair of tinkers going from\r\none place to
    another, and not knowing anything at all of fine things;\r\nbut himself was walking
    along the road looking for strange, high\r\nadventures, and it\u2019s a man like
    that a woman would be wishing to marry\r\nif he was twice as old as he is. When
    did either of you go out in the\r\ndaylight looking for a god and you not caring
    what might happen to you\r\nor where you went?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat I\u2019m
    thinking,\u201D said the second man, \u201Cis that if you leave the gods\r\nalone
    they\u2019ll leave you alone. It\u2019s no trouble to them to do whatever is\r\nright
    themselves, and what call would men like us have to go mixing or\r\nmeddling
    with their high affairs?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought all along that you were
    a timid man,\u201D said she, \u201Cand now I\r\nknow it.\u201D She turned again
    to the Philosopher--\u201CTake off your boots,\r\nMister Honey, the way you\u2019ll
    rest easy, and I\u2019ll be making down a soft\r\nbed for you in the cart.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn
    order to take off his boots the Philosopher had to stand up, for in\r\nthe cart
    they were too cramped for freedom. He moved backwards a space\r\nfrom the fire
    and took off his boots. He could see the woman stretching\r\nsacks and clothes
    inside the cart, and the two men smoking quietly and\r\nhanding the big bottle
    from one to the other. Then in his stockinged\r\nfeet he stepped a little farther
    from the fire, and, after another look,\r\nhe turned and walked quietly away
    into the blackness. In a few minutes\r\nhe heard a shout from behind him, and
    then a number of shouts and then\r\nthese died away into a plaintive murmur of
    voices, and next he was alone\r\nin the greatest darkness he had ever known.\r\n\r\nHe
    put on his boots and walked onwards. He had no idea where the road\r\nlay, and
    every moment he stumbled into a patch of heather or prickly\r\nfurze. The ground
    was very uneven with unexpected mounds and deep\r\nhollows: here and there were
    water-soaked, soggy places, and into these\r\ncold ruins he sank ankle deep.
    There was no longer an earth or a sky,\r\nbut only a black void and a thin wind
    and a fierce silence which seemed\r\nto listen to him as he went. Out of that
    silence a thundering laugh\r\nmight boom at an instant and stop again while he
    stood appalled in the\r\nblind vacancy.\r\n\r\nThe hill began to grow more steep
    and rocks were lying everywhere in his\r\npath. He could not see an inch in front,
    and so he went with his hands\r\nout-stretched like a blind man who stumbles
    painfully along. After a\r\ntime he was nearly worn out with cold and weariness,
    but he dared not\r\nsit down anywhere; the darkness was so intense that it frightened
    him,\r\nand the overwhelming, crafty silence frightened him also.\r\n\r\nAt last,
    and at a great distance, he saw a flickering, waving light, and\r\nhe went towards
    this through drifts of heather, and over piled rocks and\r\nsodden bogland. When
    he came to the light he saw it was a torch of thick\r\nbranches, the flame whereof
    blew hither and thither on the wind. The\r\ntorch was fastened against a great
    cliff of granite by an iron band. At\r\none side there was a dark opening in
    the rock, so he said: \u201CI will go\r\nin there and sleep until the morning
    comes,\u201D and he went in. At a very\r\nshort distance the cleft turned again
    to the right, and here there was\r\nanother torch fixed. When he turned this
    corner he stood for an instant\r\nin speechless astonishment, and then he covered
    his face and bowed down\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III. THE
    TWO GODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCAITILIN NI MURRACHU was sitting alone
    in the little cave behind Gort na\r\nCloca Mora. Her companion had gone out as
    was his custom to walk in the\r\nsunny morning and to sound his pipe in desolate,
    green spaces whence,\r\nperhaps, the wanderer of his desire might hear the guiding
    sweetness. As\r\nshe sat she was thinking. The last few days had awakened her
    body, and\r\nhad also awakened her mind, for with the one awakening comes the
    other.\r\nThe despondency which had touched her previously when tending her\r\nfather\u2019s
    cattle came to her again, but recognizably now. She knew the\r\nthing which the
    wind had whispered in the sloping field and for which\r\nshe had no name--it
    was Happiness. Faintly she shadowed it forth,\r\nbut yet she could not see it.
    It was only a pearl-pale wraith, almost\r\nformless, too tenuous to be touched
    by her hands, and too aloof to be\r\nspoken to. Pan had told her that he was
    the giver of happiness, but he\r\nhad given her only unrest and fever and a longing
    which could not be\r\nsatisfied. Again there was a want, and she could not formulate,
    or\r\neven realize it with any closeness. Her new-born Thought had promised\r\neverything,
    even as Pan, and it had given--she could not say that it had\r\ngiven her nothing
    or anything. Its limits were too quickly divinable.\r\nShe had found the Tree
    of Knowledge, but about on every side a great\r\nwall soared blackly enclosing
    her in from the Tree of Life--a wall which\r\nher thought was unable to surmount
    even while instinct urged that\r\nit must topple before her advance; but instinct
    may not advance when\r\nthought has schooled it in the science of unbelief; and
    this wall will\r\nnot be conquered until Thought and Instinct are wed, and the
    first son\r\nof that bridal will be called The Scaler of the Wall.\r\n\r\nSo,
    after the quiet weariness of ignorance, the unquiet weariness\r\nof thought had
    fallen upon her. That travail of mind which, through\r\ncountless generations,
    has throed to the birth of an ecstasy, the\r\nprophecy which humanity has sworn
    must be fulfilled, seeing through\r\nwhatever mists and doubtings the vision
    of a gaiety wherein the\r\ninnocence of the morning will not any longer be strange
    to our maturity.\r\n\r\nWhile she was so thinking Pan returned, a little disheartened
    that he\r\nhad found no person to listen to his pipings. He had been seated but
    a\r\nlittle time when suddenly, from without, a chorus of birds burst into\r\njoyous
    singing. Limpid and liquid cadenzas, mellow flutings, and the\r\nsweet treble
    of infancy met and danced and piped in the airy soundings.\r\nA round, soft tenderness
    of song rose and fell, broadened and soared,\r\nand then the high flight was
    snatched, eddied a moment, and was borne\r\naway to a more slender and wonderful
    loftiness, until, from afar, that\r\nthrilling song turned on the very apex of
    sweetness, dipped steeply and\r\nflashed its joyous return to the exultations
    of its mates below, rolling\r\nan ecstasy of song which for one moment gladdened
    the whole world and\r\nthe sad people who moved thereon; then the singing ceased
    as suddenly\r\nas it began, a swift shadow darkened the passage, and Angus Og
    came into\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\nCaitilin sprang from her seat Frighted, and Pan
    also made a half\r\nmovement towards rising, but instantly sank back again to
    his negligent,\r\neasy posture.\r\n\r\nThe god was slender and as swift as a
    wind. His hair swung about his\r\nface like golden blossoms. His eyes were mild
    and dancing and his lips\r\nsmiled with quiet sweetness. About his head there
    flew perpetually a\r\nring of singing birds, and when he spoke his voice came
    sweetly from a\r\ncentre of sweetness.\r\n\r\n\u201CHealth to you, daughter of
    Murrachu,\u201D said he, and he sat down.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not know you, sir,\u201D
    the terrified girl whispered.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot be known until I make myself
    known,\u201D he replied. \u201CI am called\r\nInfinite Joy, O daughter of Murrachu,
    and I am called Love.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed doubtfully from one to the
    other.\r\n\r\nPan looked up from his pipes.\r\n\r\n\u201CI also am called Love,\u201D
    said he gently, \u201Cand I am called Joy.\u201D\r\n\r\nAngus Og looked for the
    first time at Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CSinger of the Vine,\u201D said he, \u201CI know
    your names-they are Desire and\r\nFever and Lust and Death. Why have you come
    from your own place to spy\r\nupon my pastures and my quiet fields?\u201D\r\n\r\nPan
    replied mildly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe mortal gods move by the Immortal Will, and,
    therefore, I am here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I am here,\u201D said Angus.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive
    me a sign,\u201D said Pan, \u201Cthat I must go.\u201D\r\n\r\nAngus Og lifted
    his hand and from without there came again the\r\ntriumphant music of the birds.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is a sign,\u201D said he, \u201Cthe voice of Dana speaking in the air,\u201D
    and,\r\nsaying so, he made obeisance to the great mother.\r\n\r\nPan lifted his
    hand, and from afar there came the lowing of the cattle\r\nand the thin voices
    of the goats.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a sign,\u201D said he, \u201Cthe voice of Demeter
    speaking from the earth,\u201D\r\n and he also bowed deeply to the mother of
    the world.\r\n\r\nAgain Angus Og lifted his hand, and in it there appeared a
    spear, bright\r\nand very terrible.\r\n\r\nBut Pan only said, \u201CCan a spear
    divine the Eternal Will?\u201D and Angus Og\r\nput his weapon aside, and he said:
    \u201CThe girl will choose between us, for\r\nthe Divine Mood shines in the heart
    of man.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen Caitilin Ni Murrachu came forward and sat between the
    gods, but\r\nPan stretched out his hand and drew her to him, so that she sat
    resting\r\nagainst his shoulder and his arm was about her body.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    will speak the truth to this girl,\u201D said Angus Og.\r\n\r\n\u201CCan the
    gods speak otherwise?\u201D said Pan, and he laughed with delight.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is the difference between us,\u201D replied Angus Og. \u201CShe will judge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShepherd
    Girl,\u201D said Pan, pressing her with his arm, \u201Cyou will\r\njudge between
    us. Do you know what is the greatest thing in the\r\nworld?--because it is of
    that you will have to judge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have heard,\u201D the girl
    replied, \u201Ctwo things called the greatest\r\nthings. You,\u201D she continued
    to Pan, \u201Csaid it was Hunger, and long ago my\r\nfather said that Commonsense
    was the greatest thing in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have not told you,\u201D
    said Angus Og, \u201Cwhat I consider is the greatest\r\nthing in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is your right to speak,\u201D said Pan.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe greatest thing in the
    world,\u201D said Angus Og, \u201Cis the Divine\r\nImagination.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNow,\u201D
    said Pan, \u201Cwe know all the greatest things and we can talk of\r\nthem.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    daughter of Murrachu,\u201D continued Angus Og, \u201Chas told us what you\r\nthink
    and what her father thinks, but she has not told us what she\r\nthinks herself.
    Tell us, Caitilin Ni Murrachu, what you think is the\r\ngreatest thing in the
    world.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Caitilin Ni Murrachu thought for a few moments and then
    replied\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think that Happiness is the greatest thing
    in the world,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\nHearing this they sat in silence for a little
    time, and then Angus\r\nOg spoke again \u201CThe Divine Imagination may only
    be known through the\r\nthoughts of His creatures. A man has said Commonsense
    and a woman has\r\nsaid Happiness are the greatest things in the world. These
    things are\r\nmale and female, for Commonsense is Thought and Happiness is Emotion,\r\nand
    until they embrace in Love the will of Immensity cannot be fruitful.\r\nFor,
    behold, there has been no marriage of humanity since time began.\r\nMen have
    but coupled with their own shadows. The desire that sprang from\r\ntheir heads
    they pursued, and no man has yet known the love of a woman.\r\nAnd women have
    mated with the shadows of their own hearts, thinking\r\nfondly that the arms
    of men were about them. I saw my son dancing with\r\nan Idea, and I said to him,
    \u2018With what do you dance, my son?\u2019 and he\r\nreplied, \u2018I make merry
    with the wife of my affection,\u2019 and truly she was\r\nshaped as a woman is
    shaped, but it was an Idea he danced with and not\r\na woman. And presently he
    went away to his labours, and then his Idea\r\narose and her humanity came upon
    her so that she was clothed with beauty\r\nand terror, and she went apart and
    danced with the servant of my son,\r\nand there was great joy of that dancing--for
    a person in the wrong place\r\nis an Idea and not a person. Man is Thought and
    woman is Intuition, and\r\nthey have never mated. There is a gulf between them
    and it is called\r\nFear, and what they fear is, that their strengths shall be
    taken from\r\nthem and they may no longer be tyrants. The Eternal has made love
    blind,\r\nfor it is not by science, but by intuition alone, that he may come
    to\r\nhis beloved; but desire, which is science, has many eyes and sees so\r\nvastly
    that he passes his love in the press, saying there is no love,\r\nand he propagates
    miserably on his own delusions. The finger-tips are\r\nguided by God, but the
    devil looks through the eyes of all creatures so\r\nthat they may wander in the
    errors of reason and justify themselves\r\nof their wanderings. The desire of
    a man shall be Beauty, but he has\r\nfashioned a slave in his mind and called
    it Virtue. The desire of a\r\nwoman shall be Wisdom, but she has formed a beast
    in her blood and\r\ncalled it Courage: but the real virtue is courage, and the
    real courage\r\nis liberty, and the real liberty is wisdom, and Wisdom is the
    son of\r\nThought and Intuition; and his names also are Innocence and Adoration\r\nand
    Happiness.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen Angus Og had said these words he ceased, and for
    a time there was\r\nsilence in the little cave. Caitilin had covered her face
    with her hands\r\nand would not look at him, but Pan drew the girl closer to
    his side and\r\npeered sideways, laughing at Angus.\r\n\r\n\u201CHas the time
    yet come for the girl to judge between us?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CDaughter
    of Murrachu,\u201D said Angus Og, \u201Cwill you come away with me from\r\nthis
    place?\u201D\r\n\r\nCaitilin then looked at the god in great distress. \u201CI
    do not know what\r\nto do,\u201D said she. \u201CWhy do you both want me? I have
    given myself to Pan,\r\nand his arms are about me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI want
    you,\u201D said Angus Og, \u201Cbecause the world has forgotten me. In all\r\nmy
    nation there is no remembrance of me. I, wandering on the hills of my\r\ncountry,
    am lonely indeed. I am the desolate god forbidden to utter\r\nmy happy laughter.
    I hide the silver of my speech and the gold of my\r\nmerriment. I live in the
    holes of the rocks and the dark caves of the\r\nsea. I weep in the morning because
    I may not laugh, and in the evening I\r\ngo abroad and am not happy. Where I
    have kissed a bird has flown; where\r\nI have trod a flower has sprung. But Thought
    has snared my birds in\r\nhis nets and sold them in the market-places. Who will
    deliver me from\r\nThought, from the base holiness of Intellect, the maker of
    chains\r\nand traps? Who will save me from the holy impurity of Emotion, whose\r\ndaughters
    are Envy and Jealousy and Hatred, who plucks my flowers to\r\nornament her lusts
    and my little leaves to shrivel on the breasts of\r\ninfamy? Lo, I am sealed
    in the caves of nonentity until the head and the\r\nheart shall come together
    in fruitfulness, until Thought has wept for\r\nLove, and Emotion has purified
    herself to meet her lover. Tirna-nog is\r\nthe heart of a man and the head of
    a woman. Widely they are separated.\r\nSelf-centred they stand, and between them
    the seas of space are flooding\r\ndesolately. No voice can shout across those
    shores. No eye can bridge\r\nthem, nor any desire bring them together until the
    blind god shall find\r\nthem on the wavering stream--not as an arrow searches
    straightly from\r\na bow, but gently, imperceptibly as a feather on the wind
    reaches the\r\nground on a hundred starts; not with the compass and the chart,
    but by\r\nthe breath of the Almighty which blows from all quarters without care\r\nand
    without ceasing. Night and day it urges from the outside to the\r\ninside. It
    gathers ever to the centre. From the far without to the deep\r\nwithin, trembling
    from the body to the soul until the head of a woman\r\nand the heart of a man
    are filled with the Divine Imagination. Hymen,\r\nHymenaea! I sing to the ears
    that are stopped, the eyes that are sealed,\r\nand the minds that do not labour.
    Sweetly I sing on the hillside. The\r\nblind shall look within and not without;
    the deaf shall hearken to\r\nthe murmur of their own veins, and be enchanted
    with the wisdom of\r\nsweetness; the thoughtless shall think without effort as
    the lightning\r\nflashes, that the hand of Innocence may reach to the stars,
    that the\r\nfeet of Adoration may dance to the Father of Joy, and the laugh of\r\nHappiness
    be answered by the Voice of Benediction.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus Angus Og sang in the
    cave, and ere he had ceased Caitilin Ni\r\nMurrachu withdrew herself from the
    arms of her desires. But so strong\r\nwas the hold of Pan upon her that when
    she was free her body bore the\r\nmarks of his grip, and many days passed away
    before these marks faded.\r\n\r\nThen Pan arose in silence, taking his double
    reed in his hand, and the\r\ngirl wept, beseeching him to stay to be her brother
    and the brother of\r\nher beloved, but Pan smiled and said: \u201CYour beloved
    is my father and\r\nmy son. He is yesterday and to-morrow. He is the nether and
    the upper\r\nmillstone, and I am crushed between until I kneel again before the\r\nthrone
    from whence I came,\u201D and, saying so, he embraced Angus Og most\r\ntenderly
    and went his way to the quiet fields, and across the slopes of\r\nthe mountains,
    and beyond the blue distances of space.\r\n\r\nAnd in a little time Caitilin
    Ni Murrachu went with her companion\r\nacross the brow of the hill, and she did
    not go with him because she had\r\nunderstood his words, nor because he was naked
    and unashamed, but only\r\nbecause his need of her was very great, and, therefore,
    she loved\r\nhim, and stayed his feet in the way, and was concerned lest he should\r\nstumble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK
    IV. THE PHILOSOPHER\u2019S RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nWHICH is,
    the Earth or the creatures that move upon it, the more\r\nimportant? This is
    a question prompted solely by intellectual arrogance,\r\nfor in life there is
    no greater and no less. The thing that is has\r\njustified its own importance
    by mere existence, for that is the great\r\nand equal achievement. If life were
    arranged for us from without such a\r\nquestion of supremacy would assume importance,
    but life is always from\r\nwithin, and is modified or extended by our own appetites,
    aspirations,\r\nand central activities. From without we get pollen and the refreshment\r\nof
    space and quietude--it is sufficient. We might ask, is the Earth\r\nanything
    more than an extension of our human consciousness, or are we,\r\nmoving creatures,
    only projections of the Earth\u2019s antennae? But these\r\nmatters have no value
    save as a field wherein Thought, like a wise lamb,\r\nmay frolic merrily. And
    all would be very well if Thought would but\r\ncontinue to frolic, instead of
    setting up first as locum tenens for\r\nIntuition and sticking to the job, and
    afterwards as the counsel and\r\ncritic of Omnipotence. Everything has two names,
    and everything is\r\ntwofold. The name of male Thought as it faces the world
    is Philosophy,\r\nbut the name it bears in Tirna-nog is Delusion. Female Thought
    is called\r\nSocialism on earth, but in Eternity it is known as Illusion; and
    this\r\nis so because there has been no matrimony of minds, but only an\r\nhermaphroditic
    propagation of automatic ideas, which in their due\r\nrotation assume dominance
    and reign severely. To the world this system\r\nof thought, because it is consecutive,
    is known as Logic, but Eternity\r\nhas written it down in the Book of Errors
    as Mechanism: for life may not\r\nbe consecutive, but explosive and variable,
    else it is a shackled and\r\ntimorous slave.\r\n\r\nOne of the great troubles
    of life is that Reason has taken charge of the\r\nadministration of Justice,
    and by mere identification it has achieved\r\nthe crown and sceptre of its master.
    But the imperceptible usurpation\r\nwas recorded, and discriminating minds understand
    the chasm which still\r\ndivides the pretender Law from the exiled King. In a
    like manner, and\r\nwith feigned humility, the Cold Demon advanced to serve Religion,
    and by\r\nguile and violence usurped her throne; but the pure in heart still
    fly\r\nfrom the spectre Theology to dance in ecstasy before the starry and\r\neternal
    goddess. Statecraft, also, that tender Shepherd of the Flocks,\r\nhas been despoiled
    of his crook and bell, and wanders in unknown\r\ndesolation while, beneath the
    banner of Politics, Reason sits howling\r\nover an intellectual chaos.\r\n\r\nJustice
    is the maintaining of equilibrium. The blood of Cain must cry,\r\nnot from the
    lips of the Avenger, but from the aggrieved Earth herself\r\nwho demands that
    atonement shall be made for a disturbance of her\r\nconsciousness. All justice
    is, therefore, readjustment. A thwarted\r\nconsciousness has every right to clamour
    for assistance, but not for\r\npunishment. This latter can only be sought by
    timorous and egotistic\r\nIntellect, which sees the Earth from which it has emerged
    and into which\r\nit must return again in its own despite, and so, being self-centred
    and\r\nenvious and a renegade from life, Reason is more cruelly unjust, and\r\nmore
    timorous than any other manifestation of the divinely erratic\r\nenergy--erratic,
    because, as has been said, \u201Cthe crooked roads are the\r\nroads of genius.\u201D
    Nature grants to all her creatures an unrestricted\r\nliberty, quickened by competitive
    appetite, to succeed or to fail; save\r\nonly to Reason, her Demon of Order,
    which can do neither, and\r\nwhose wings she has clipped for some reason with
    which I am not yet\r\nacquainted. It may be that an unrestricted mentality would
    endanger\r\nher own intuitive perceptions by shackling all her other organs of\r\nperception,
    or annoy her by vexatious efforts at creative rivalry.\r\n\r\nIt will, therefore,
    be understood that when the Leprecauns of Gort\r\nna Cloca Mora acted in the
    manner about to be recorded, they were not\r\nprompted by any lewd passion for
    revenge, but were merely striving to\r\nreconstruct a rhythm which was their
    very existence, and which must have\r\nbeen of direct importance to the Earth.
    Revenge is the vilest passion\r\nknown to life. It has made Law possible, and
    by doing so it gave\r\nto Intellect the first grip at that universal dominion
    which is its\r\nambition. A Leprecaun is of more value to the Earth than is a
    Prime\r\nMinister or a stockbroker, because a Leprecaun dances and makes\r\nmerry,
    while a Prime Minister knows nothing of these natural\r\nvirtues--consequently,
    an injury done to a Leprecaun afflicts the\r\nEarth with misery, and justice
    is, for these reasons, an imperative and\r\nmomentous necessity.\r\n\r\nA community
    of Leprecauns without a crock of gold is a blighted and\r\nmerriless community,
    and they are certainly justified in seeking\r\nsympathy and assistance for the
    recovery of so essential a treasure. But\r\nthe steps whereby the Leprecauns
    of Gort na Cloca Mora sought to regain\r\ntheir property must for ever brand
    their memory with a certain odium.\r\nIt should be remembered in their favour
    that they were cunningly and\r\ncruelly encompassed. Not only was their gold
    stolen, but it was buried\r\nin such a position as placed it under the protection
    of their own\r\ncommunal honour, and the household of their enemy was secured
    against\r\ntheir active and righteous malice, because the Thin Woman of Inis\r\nMagrath
    belonged to the most powerful Shee of Ireland. It is in\r\ncircumstances such
    as these that dangerous alliances are made, and,\r\nfor the first time in history,
    the elemental beings invoked bourgeois\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThey were loath
    to do it, and justice must record the fact. They\r\nwere angry when they did
    it, and anger is both mental and intuitive\r\nblindness. It is not the beneficent
    blindness which prevents one from\r\nseeing without, but it is that desperate
    darkness which cloaks the\r\nwithin, and hides the heart and the brain from each
    other\u2019s husbandry\r\nand wifely recognition. But even those mitigating circumstances
    cannot\r\njustify the course they adopted, and the wider idea must be sought
    for,\r\nthat out of evil good must ultimately come, or else evil is vitiated\r\nbeyond
    even the redemption of usage. When they were able to realize of\r\nwhat they
    had been guilty, they were very sorry indeed, and endeavoured\r\nto publish their
    repentance in many ways; but, lacking atonement,\r\nrepentance is only a post-mortem
    virtue which is good for nothing but\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nWhen the Leprecauns of
    Gort na Cloca Mora found they were unable\r\nto regain their crock of gold by
    any means they laid an anonymous\r\ninformation at the nearest Police Station
    showing that two dead bodies\r\nwould be found under the hearthstone in the hut
    of Coille Doraca, and\r\nthe inference to be drawn from their crafty missive
    was that\r\nthese bodies had been murdered by the Philosopher for reasons very\r\ndiscreditable
    to him.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher had been scarcely more than three hours on his
    journey\r\nto Angus Og when four policemen approached the little house from as
    many\r\ndifferent directions, and without any trouble they effected an entrance.\r\nThe
    Thin Woman of Inis Magrath and the two children heard from afar\r\ntheir badly
    muffled advance, and on discovering the character of their\r\nvisitors they concealed
    themselves among the thickly clustering trees.\r\nShortly after the men had entered
    the hut loud and sustained noises\r\nbegan to issue therefrom, and in about twenty
    minutes the invaders\r\nemerged again bearing the bodies of the Grey Woman of
    Dun Gortin and her\r\nhusband. They wrenched the door off its hinges, and, placing
    the bodies\r\non the door, proceeded at a rapid pace through the trees and disappeared\r\nin
    a short time. When they had departed the Thin Woman and the children\r\nreturned
    to their home and over the yawning hearth the Thin Woman\r\npronounced a long
    and fervid malediction wherein policemen were\r\nexhibited naked before the blushes
    of Eternity...\r\n\r\nWith your good-will let us now return to the Philosopher.\r\n\r\nFollowing
    his interview with Angus Og the Philosopher received the\r\nblessing of the god
    and returned on his homeward journey. When he left\r\nthe cave he had no knowledge
    where he was nor whether he should turn to\r\nthe right hand or to the left.
    This alone was his guiding idea, that as\r\nhe had come up the mountain on his
    first journey his home-going must, by\r\nmere opposition, be down the mountain,
    and, accordingly, he set his\r\nface downhill and trod lustily forward. He had
    stamped up the hill with\r\nvigour, he strode down it in ecstasy. He tossed his
    voice on every wind\r\nthat went by. From the wells of forgetfulness he regained
    the shining\r\nwords and gay melodies which his childhood had delighted in, and
    these\r\nhe sang loudly and unceasingly as he marched. The sun had not yet\r\nrisen
    but, far away, a quiet brightness was creeping over the sky. The\r\ndaylight,
    however, was near the full, one slender veil only remaining of\r\nthe shadows,
    and a calm, unmoving quietude brooded from the grey sky to\r\nthe whispering
    earth. The birds had begun to bestir themselves but not\r\nto sing. Now and again
    a solitary wing feathered the chill air; but for\r\nthe most part the birds huddled
    closer in the swinging nests, or under\r\nthe bracken, or in the tufty grass.
    Here a faint twitter was heard and\r\nceased. A little farther a drowsy voice
    called \u201Ccheep-cheep\u201D and turned\r\nagain to the warmth of its wing.
    The very grasshoppers were silent. The\r\ncreatures who range in the night time
    had returned to their cells and\r\nwere setting their households in order, and
    those who belonged to the\r\nday hugged their comfort for but one minute longer.
    Then the first level\r\nbeam stepped like a mild angel to the mountain top. The
    slender radiance\r\nbrightened and grew strong. The grey veil faded away. The
    birds leaped\r\nfrom their nests. The grasshoppers awakened and were busy at
    a stroke.\r\nVoice called to voice without ceasing, and, momently, a song thrilled\r\nfor
    a few wide seconds. But for the most part it was chatter-chatter\r\nthey went
    as they soared and plunged and swept, each bird eager for its\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher thrust his hand into his wallet and found there the last\r\nbroken
    remnants of his cake, and the instant his hand touched the food\r\nhe was seized
    by a hunger so furious that he sat down where he stopped\r\nand prepared to eat.\r\n\r\nThe
    place where he sat was a raised bank under a hedge, and this place\r\ndirectly
    fronted a clumsy wooden gate leading into a great field. When\r\nthe Philosopher
    had seated himself he raised his eyes and saw through\r\nthe gate a small company
    approaching. There were four men and three\r\nwomen, and each of them carried
    a metal pail. The Philosopher with a\r\nsigh returned the cake to his wallet,
    saying:\r\n\r\n\u201CAll men are brothers, and it may be that these people are
    as hungry as\r\nI am.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn a short time the strangers came near. The
    foremost of them was a huge\r\nman who was bearded to the eyelids and who moved
    like a strong wind. He\r\nopened the gate by removing a piece of wood wherewith
    it was jammed, and\r\nhe and his companions passed through, whereupon he closed
    the gate\r\nand secured it. To this man, as being the eldest, the Philosopher\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am about to breakfast,\u201D said he, \u201Cand if you are hungry perhaps you\r\nwould
    like to eat with me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not,\u201D said the man, \u201Cfor
    the person who would refuse a kind\r\ninvitation is a dog. These are my three
    sons and three of my daughters,\r\nand we are all thankful to you.\u201D\r\n\r\nSaying
    this he sat down on the bank and his companions, placing their\r\npails behind
    them, did likewise. The Philosopher divided his cake into\r\neight pieces and
    gave one to each person.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am sorry it is so little,\u201D said
    he.\r\n\r\n\u201CA gift,\u201D said the bearded man, \u201Cis never little,\u201D
    and he courteously\r\nate his piece in three bites although he could have easily
    eaten it in\r\none, and his children also.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat was a good, satisfying
    cake,\u201D said he when he had finished;\r\n\u201Cit was well baked and well
    shared, but,\u201D he continued, \u201CI am in a\r\ndifficulty and maybe you
    could advise me what to do, sir?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat might be your trouble?\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is this,\u201D said the man. \u201CEvery
    morning when we go out to milk the\r\ncows the mother of my clann gives to each
    of us a parcel of food so that\r\nwe need not be any hungrier than we like; but
    now we have had a good\r\nbreakfast with you, what shall we do with the food
    that we brought with\r\nus? The woman of the house would not be pleased if we
    carried it back\r\nto her, and if we threw food away it would be a sin. If it
    was not\r\ndisrespectful to your breakfast the boys and girls here might be able\r\nto
    get rid of it by eating it, for, as you know, young people can always\r\neat
    a bit more, no matter how much they have already eaten.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    would surely be better to eat it than to waste it,\u201D said the\r\nPhilosopher
    wistfully.\r\n\r\nThe young people produced large parcels of food from their
    pockets and\r\nopened them, and the bearded man said, \u201CI have a little one
    myself also,\r\nand it would not be wasted if you were kind enough to help me
    to eat\r\nit,\u201D and he pulled out his parcel, which was twice as big as any
    of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nHe opened the parcel and handed the larger part of its
    contents to the\r\nPhilosopher; he then plunged a tin vessel into one of the
    milk pails and\r\nset this also by the Philosopher, and, instantly, they all
    began to eat\r\nwith furious appetite.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was finished the
    Philosopher filled his tobacco pipe and\r\nthe bearded man and his three sons
    did likewise.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D said the bearded man, \u201CI would be
    glad to know why you are\r\ntravelling abroad so early in the morning, for, at
    this hour, no one\r\nstirs but the sun and the birds and the folk who, like ourselves,
    follow\r\nthe cattle?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will tell you that gladly,\u201D said
    the Philosopher, \u201Cif you will tell\r\nme your name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    name,\u201D said the bearded man, \u201Cis Mac Cul.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLast night,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, \u201Cwhen I came from the house of Angus\r\nOg in the
    Caves of the Sleepers of Erinn I was bidden say to a man named\r\nMac Cul-that
    the horses had trampled in their sleep and the sleepers had\r\nturned on their
    sides.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D said the bearded man, \u201Cyour words thrill
    in my heart like music,\r\nbut my head does not understand them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have learned,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cthat the head does not hear\r\nanything
    until the heart has listened, and that what the heart knows\r\nto-day the head
    will understand to-morrow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll the birds of the world are
    singing in my soul,\u201D said the bearded\r\nman, \u201Cand I bless you because
    you have filled me with hope and pride.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the Philosopher shook
    him by the hand, and he shook the hands of his\r\nsons and daughters who bowed
    before him at the mild command of their\r\nfather, and when he had gone a little
    way he looked around again and\r\nhe saw that group of people standing where
    he had left them, and the\r\nbearded man was embracing his children on the highroad.\r\n\r\nA
    bend in the path soon shut them from view, and then the Philosopher,\r\nfortified
    by food and the freshness of the morning, strode onwards\r\nsinging for very
    joy. It was still early, but now the birds had eaten\r\ntheir breakfasts and
    were devoting themselves to each other. They rested\r\nside by side on the branches
    of the trees and on the hedges, they danced\r\nin the air in happy brotherhoods
    and they sang to one another amiable\r\nand pleasant ditties.\r\n\r\nWhen the
    Philosopher had walked for a long time he felt a little weary\r\nand sat down
    to refresh himself in the shadow of a great tree. Hard by\r\nthere was a house
    of rugged stone. Long years ago it had been a castle,\r\nand, even now, though
    patched by time and misfortune its front was\r\nwarlike and frowning. While he
    sat a young woman came along the road and\r\nstood gazing earnestly at this house.
    Her hair was as black as night and\r\nas smooth as still water, but her face
    came so stormily forward that her\r\nquiet attitude had yet no quietness in it.
    To her, after a few moments,\r\nthe Philosopher spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CGirl,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cwhy do you look so earnestly at the house?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe girl
    turned her pale face and stared at him.\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not notice you sitting
    under the tree,\u201D said she, and she came\r\nslowly forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CSit
    down by me,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cand we will talk. If you are in\r\nany
    trouble tell it to me, and perhaps you will talk the heaviest part\r\naway.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will sit beside you willingly,\u201D said the girl, and she did so.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is good to talk trouble over,\u201D he continued. \u201CDo you know that\r\ntalk
    is a real thing? There is more power in speech than many people\r\nconceive.
    Thoughts come from God, they are born through the marriage\r\nof the head and
    the lungs. The head moulds the thought into the form of\r\nwords, then it is
    borne and sounded on the air which has been already in\r\nthe secret kingdoms
    of the body, which goes in bearing life and come out\r\nfreighted with wisdom.
    For this reason a lie is very terrible, because\r\nit is turning mighty and incomprehensible
    things to base uses, and is\r\nburdening the life-giving element with a foul
    return for its goodness;\r\nbut those who speak the truth and whose words are
    the symbols of wisdom\r\nand beauty, these purify the whole world and daunt contagion.
    The only\r\ntrouble the body can know is disease. All other miseries come from
    the\r\nbrain, and, as these belong to thought, they can be driven out by their\r\nmaster
    as unruly and unpleasant vagabonds; for a mental trouble should\r\nbe spoken
    to, confronted, reprimanded and so dismissed. The brain cannot\r\nafford to harbour
    any but pleasant and eager citizens who will do their\r\npart in making laughter
    and holiness for the world, for that is the duty\r\nof thought.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile
    the Philosopher spoke the girl had been regarding him steadfastly.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D
    said she, \u201Cwe tell our hearts to a young man and our heads to an\r\nold
    man, and when the heart is a fool the head is bound to be a liar.\r\nI can tell
    you the things I know, but how will I tell you the things I\r\nfeel when I myself
    do not understand them? If I say these words to you\r\n\u2018I love a man\u2019
    I do not say anything at all, and you do not hear one\r\nof the words which my
    heart is repeating over and over to itself in the\r\nsilence of my body. Young
    people are fools in their heads and old people\r\nare fools in their hearts,
    and they can only look at each other and pass\r\nby in wonder.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    are wrong,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CAn old person can take your hand\r\nlike
    this and say, \u2018May every good thing come to you, my daughter.\u2019 For\r\nall
    trouble there is sympathy, and for love there is memory, and these\r\nare the
    head and the heart talking to each other in quiet friendship.\r\nWhat the heart
    knows to-day the head will understand to-morrow, and\r\nas the head must be the
    scholar of the heart it is necessary that our\r\nhearts be purified and free
    from every false thing, else we are tainted\r\nbeyond personal redemption.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D
    said the girl, \u201CI know of two great follies-they are love and\r\nspeech,
    for when these are given they can never be taken back again, and\r\nthe person
    to whom these are given is not any richer, but the giver is\r\nmade poor and
    abashed. I gave my love to a man who did not want it.\r\nI told him of my love,
    and he lifted his eyelids at me; that is my\r\ntrouble.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor a moment
    the Philosopher sat in stricken silence looking on the\r\nground. He had a strange
    disinclination to look at the girl although he\r\nfelt her eyes fixed steadily
    on him. But in a little while he did look\r\nat her and spoke again.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo
    carry gifts to an ungrateful person cannot be justified and need not\r\nbe mourned
    for. If your love is noble why do you treat it meanly? If it\r\nis lewd the man
    was right to reject it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe love as the wind blows,\u201D she
    replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is a thing,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cand
    it is both the biggest\r\nand the littlest thing in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    is that?\u201D said the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is pride,\u201D he answered. \u201CIt
    lives in an empty house. The head which\r\nhas never been visited by the heart
    is the house pride lives in. You\r\nare in error, my dear, and not in love. Drive
    out the knave pride, put a\r\nflower in your hair and walk freely again.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    girl laughed, and suddenly her pale face became rosy as the dawn and\r\nas radiant
    and lovely as a cloud. She shed warmth and beauty about her\r\nas she leaned
    forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are wrong,\u201D she whispered, \u201Cbecause he does
    love me; but he does\r\nnot know it yet. He is young and full of fury, and has
    no time to look\r\nat women, but he looked at me. My heart knows it and my head
    knows it,\r\nbut I am impatient and yearn for him to look at me again. His heart
    will\r\nremember me to-morrow, and he will come searching for me with prayers\r\nand
    tears, with shouts and threats. I will be very hard to find\r\nto-morrow when
    he holds out his arms to the air and the sky, and is\r\nastonished and frightened
    to find me nowhere. I will hide from him\r\nto-morrow, and frown at him when
    he speaks, and turn aside when he\r\nfollows me: until the day after to-morrow
    when he will frighten me with\r\nhis anger, and hold me with his furious hands,
    and make me look at him.\u201D\r\n\r\nSaying this the girl arose and prepared
    to go away.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe is in that house,\u201D said she, \u201Cand I would
    not let him see me here\r\nfor anything in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    have wasted all my time,\u201D said the Philosopher, smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    else is time for?\u201D said the girl, and she kissed the Philosopher\r\nand
    ran swiftly down the road.\r\n\r\nShe had been gone but a few moments when a
    man came out of the grey\r\nhouse and walked quickly across the grass. When he
    reached the hedge\r\nseparating the field from the road he tossed his two arms
    in the air,\r\nswung them down, and jumped over the hedge into the roadway. He
    was a\r\nshort, dark youth, and so swift and sudden were his movements that\r\nhe
    seemed to look on every side at the one moment although he bore\r\nfuriously
    to his own direction.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher addressed him mildly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    was a good jump,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nThe young man spun around from where he
    stood, and was by the\r\nPhilosopher\u2019s side in an instant.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    would be a good jump for other men,\u201D said he, \u201Cbut it is only a\r\nlittle
    jump for me. You are very dusty, sir; you must have travelled a\r\nlong distance
    to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA long distance,\u201D replied the Philosopher. \u201CSit
    down here, my friend,\r\nand keep me company for a little time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do not like sitting down,\u201D said the young man, \u201Cbut I always consent\r\nto
    a request, and I always accept friendship.\u201D And, so saying, he threw\r\nhimself
    down on the grass.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you work in that big house?\u201D said the
    Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D he replied. \u201CI train the hounds for
    a fat, jovial man, full of\r\nlaughter and insolence.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think
    you do not like your master.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBelieve, sir, that I do not like
    any master; but this man I hate. I\r\nhave been a week in his service, and he
    has not once looked on me as on\r\na friend. This very day, in the kennel, he
    passed me as though I were\r\na tree or a stone. I almost leaped to catch him
    by the throat and say:\r\n\u2018Dog, do you not salute your fellow-man?\u2019
    But I looked after him and let\r\nhim go, for it would be an unpleasant thing
    to strangle a fat person.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you are displeased with your
    master should you not look for another\r\noccupation?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    was thinking of that, and I was thinking whether I ought to kill him\r\nor marry
    his daughter. She would have passed me by as her father did,\r\nbut I would not
    let a woman do that to me: no man would.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did you do to
    her?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe young man chuckled \u201CI did not
    look at her the first time, and when\r\nshe came near me the second time I looked
    another way, and on the third\r\nday she spoke to me, and while she stood I looked
    over her shoulder\r\ndistantly. She said she hoped I would be happy in my new
    home, and she\r\nmade her voice sound pleasant while she said it; but I thanked
    her and\r\nturned away carelessly.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs the girl beautiful?\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not know,\u201D he replied; \u201CI have
    not looked at her yet, although\r\nnow I see her everywhere. I think she is a
    woman who would annoy me if I\r\nmarried her.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you haven\u2019t
    seen her, how can you think that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe has tame feet,\u201D
    said the youth. \u201CI looked at them and they got\r\nfrightened. Where have
    you travelled from, sir?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will tell you that,\u201D said
    the Philosopher, \u201Cif you will tell me your\r\nname.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is easily told,\u201D he answered; \u201Cmy name is MacCulain.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen
    I came last night,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cfrom the place of Angus\r\nOg
    in the cave of the Sleepers of Erinn I was bidden say to a man named\r\nMacCulain
    that The Grey of Macha had neighed in his sleep and the sword\r\nof Laeg clashed
    on the floor as he turned in his slumber.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe young man leaped from
    the grass.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D said he in a strained voice, \u201CI do not
    understand your words, but\r\nthey make my heart to dance and sing within me
    like a bird.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you listen to your heart,\u201D said the Philosopher,
    \u201Cyou will learn\r\nevery good thing, for the heart is the fountain of wisdom
    tossing its\r\nthoughts up to the brain which gives them form,\u201D--and, so
    saying, he\r\nsaluted the youth and went again on his way by the curving road.\r\n\r\nNow
    the day had advanced, noon was long past, and the strong sunlight\r\nblazed ceaselessly
    on the world. His path was still on the high\r\nmountains, running on for a short
    distance and twisting perpetually to\r\nthe right hand and to the left. One might
    scarcely call it a path, it\r\ngrew so narrow. Sometimes, indeed, it almost ceased
    to be a path, for\r\nthe grass had stolen forward inch by inch to cover up the
    tracks of man.\r\nThere were no hedges but rough, tumbled ground only, which
    was patched\r\nby trailing bushes and stretched away in mounds and hummocks beyond
    the\r\nfar horizon. There was a deep silence everywhere, not painful, for where\r\nthe
    sun shines there is no sorrow: the only sound to be heard was the\r\nswish of
    long grasses against his feet as he trod, and the buzz of an\r\noccasional bee
    that came and was gone in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher was very hungry,
    and he looked about on all sides to see\r\nif there was anything he might eat.
    \u201CIf I were a goat or a cow,\u201D said\r\nhe, \u201CI could eat this grass
    and be nourished. If I were a donkey I could\r\ncrop the hard thistles which
    are growing on every hand, or if I were\r\na bird I could feed on the caterpillars
    and creeping things which stir\r\ninnumerably everywhere. But a man may not eat
    even in the midst of\r\nplenty, because he has departed from nature, and lives
    by crafty and\r\ntwisted thought.\u201D\r\n\r\nSpeaking in this manner he chanced
    to lift his eyes from the ground and\r\nsaw, far away, a solitary figure which
    melted into the folding earth and\r\nreappeared again in a different place. So
    peculiar and erratic were the\r\nmovements of this figure that the Philosopher
    had great difficulty in\r\nfollowing it, and, indeed, would have been unable
    to follow, but that\r\nthe other chanced in his direction. When they came nearer
    he saw it\r\nwas a young boy, who was dancing hither and thither in any and every\r\ndirection.
    A bushy mound hid him for an instant, and the next they were\r\nstanding face
    to face staring at each other. After a moment\u2019s silence\r\nthe boy, who
    was about twelve years of age, and as beautiful as the\r\nmorning, saluted the
    Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you lost your way, sir?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll
    paths,\u201D the Philosopher replied, \u201Care on the earth, and so one can\r\nnever
    be lost--but I have lost my dinner.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe boy commenced to laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    are you laughing at, my son?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CBecause,\u201D
    he replied, \u201CI am bringing you your dinner. I wondered what\r\nsent me out
    in this direction, for I generally go more to the east.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave
    you got my dinner?\u201D said the Philosopher anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have,\u201D
    said the boy: \u201CI ate my own dinner at home, and I put your\r\ndinner in
    my pocket. I thought,\u201D he explained, \u201Cthat I might be hungry\r\nif
    I went far away.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe gods directed you,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    often do,\u201D said the boy, and he pulled a small parcel from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher instantly sat down, and the boy handed him the parcel.\r\nHe opened
    this and found bread and cheese.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a good dinner,\u201D
    said he, and commenced to eat.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you not like a piece also,
    my son?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would like a little piece,\u201D said the boy, and
    he sat down before the\r\nPhilosopher, and they ate together happily.\r\n\r\nWhen
    they had finished the Philosopher praised the gods, and then said,\r\nmore to
    himself than to the boy:\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I had a little drink of water I would
    want nothing else.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is a stream four paces from here,\u201D
    said his companion. \u201CI will\r\nget some water in my cap,\u201D and he leaped
    away.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he came back holding his cap tenderly, and the\r\nPhilosopher
    took this and drank the water.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want nothing more in the world,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cexcept to talk with you.\r\nThe sun is shining, the wind is pleasant,
    and the grass is soft. Sit\r\ndown beside me again for a little time.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo
    the boy sat down, and the Philosopher lit his pipe.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you live
    far from here?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot far,\u201D said the boy. \u201CYou
    could see my mother\u2019s house from this\r\nplace if you were as tall as a
    tree, and even from the ground you can\r\nsee a shape of smoke yonder that floats
    over our cottage.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher looked but could see nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    eyes are not as good as yours are,\u201D said he, \u201Cbecause I am getting\r\nold.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    does it feel like to be old?\u201D said the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt feels stiff
    like,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that all?\u201D said the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t know,\u201D the Philosopher replied after a few moments\u2019 silence.\r\n\u201CCan
    you tell me what it looks like to be young?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D
    said the boy, and then a slight look of perplexity crossed\r\nhis face, and he
    continued, \u201CI don\u2019t think I can.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYoung people,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, \u201Cdo not know what age is, and old\r\npeople forget
    what youth was. When you begin to grow old always think\r\ndeeply of your youth,
    for an old man without memories is a wasted life,\r\nand nothing is worth remembering
    but our childhood. I will tell you some\r\nof the differences between being old
    and young, and then you can ask me\r\nquestions, and so we will get at both sides
    of the matter. First, an old\r\nman gets tired quicker than a boy.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    boy thought for a moment, and then replied:\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is not a great
    difference, for a boy does get very tired.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CAn
    old man does not want to eat as often as a boy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is not
    a great difference either,\u201D the boy replied, \u201Cfor they both\r\ndo eat.
    Tell me the big difference.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not know it, my son; but
    I have always thought there was a big\r\ndifference. Perhaps it is that an old
    man has memories of things which a\r\nboy cannot even guess at.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut
    they both have memories,\u201D said the boy, laughing, \u201Cand so it is not\r\na
    big difference.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is true,\u201D said the Philosopher.
    \u201CMaybe there is not so much\r\ndifference after all. Tell me things you
    do, and we will see if I can do\r\nthem also.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t
    know what I do,\u201D he replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must know the things you do,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, \u201Cbut you may\r\nnot understand how to put them in
    order. The great trouble about any\r\nkind of examination is to know where to
    begin, but there are always two\r\nplaces in everything with which we can commence--they
    are the beginning\r\nand the end. From either of these points a view may be had
    which\r\ncomprehends the entire period. So we will begin with the things you
    did\r\nthis morning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am satisfied with that,\u201D said
    the boy.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher then continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen you awakened
    this morning and went out of the house what was the\r\nfirst thing you did?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    boy thought \u201CI went out, then I picked up a stone and threw it into\r\nthe
    field as far as I could.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat then?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen
    I ran after the stone to see could I catch up on it before it hit\r\nthe ground.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CI ran so fast that I tumbled over myself into
    the grass.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did you do after that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    lay where I fell and plucked handfuls of the grass with both hands\r\nand threw
    them on my back.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you get up then?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,
    I pressed my face into the grass and shouted a lot of times with my\r\nmouth
    against the ground, and then I sat up and did not move for a long\r\ntime.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWere
    you thinking?\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I was not thinking
    or doing anything.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy did you do all these things?\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor no reason at all,\u201D said the boy.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat,\u201D
    said the Philosopher triumphantly, \u201Cis the difference between\r\nage and
    youth. Boys do things for no reason, and old people do not.\r\nI wonder do we
    get old because we do things by reason instead of\r\ninstinct?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t know,\u201D said the boy, \u201Ceverything gets old. Have you travelled\r\nvery
    far to-day, sir?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will tell you that if you will tell me
    your name.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name,\u201D said the boy, \u201Cis MacCushin.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen
    I came last night,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cfrom the place of Angus\r\nOg
    in the Caste of the Sleepers I was bidden say to one named MacCushin\r\nthat
    a son would be born to Angus Og and his wife, Caitilin, and that\r\nthe sleepers
    of Erinn had turned in their slumbers.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe boy regarded him steadfastly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    know,\u201D said he, \u201Cwhy Angus Og sent me that message. He wants me to\r\nmake
    a poem to the people of Erinn, so that when the Sleepers arise they\r\nwill meet
    with friends.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Sleepers have arisen,\u201D said the Philosopher.
    \u201CThey are about us on\r\nevery side. They are walking now, but they have
    forgotten their names\r\nand the meanings of their names. You are to tell them
    their names and\r\ntheir lineage, for I am an old man, and my work is done.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will make a poem some day,\u201D said the boy, \u201Cand every man will shout\r\nwhen
    he hears it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGod be with you, my son,\u201D said the Philosopher,
    and he embraced the boy\r\nand went forward on his journey.\r\n\r\nAbout half
    an hour\u2019s easy travelling brought him to a point from which\r\nhe could
    see far down below to the pine trees of Coille Doraca. The\r\nshadowy evening
    had crept over the world ere he reached the wood, and\r\nwhen he entered the
    little house the darkness had already descended.\r\n\r\nThe Thin Woman of Inis
    Magrath met him as he entered, and was about to\r\nspeak harshly of his long
    absence, but the Philosopher kissed her with\r\nsuch unaccustomed tenderness,
    and spoke so mildly to her, that, first,\r\nastonishment enchained her tongue,
    and then delight set it free in a\r\ndirection to which it had long been a stranger.\r\n\r\n\u201CWife,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, \u201CI cannot say how joyful I am to see your\r\ngood
    face again.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Thin Woman was unable at first to reply to this
    salutation, but,\r\nwith incredible speed, she put on a pot of stirabout, began
    to bake a\r\ncake, and tried to roast potatoes. After a little while she wept
    loudly,\r\nand proclaimed that the world did not contain the equal of her husband\r\nfor
    comeliness and goodness, and that she was herself a sinful person\r\nunworthy
    of the kindness of the gods or of such a mate.\r\n\r\nBut while the Philosopher
    was embracing Seumas and Brigid Beg, the door\r\nwas suddenly burst open with
    a great noise, four policemen entered the\r\nlittle room, and after one dumbfoundered
    minute they retreated again\r\nbearing the Philosopher with them to answer a
    charge of murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V. THE POLICEMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XIV\r\n\r\nSOME distance down the road the policemen halted. The night had fallen\r\nbefore
    they effected their capture, and now, in the gathering darkness,\r\nthey were
    not at ease. In the first place, they knew that the occupation\r\nupon which
    they were employed was not a creditable one to a man whatever\r\nit might be
    to a policeman. The seizure of a criminal may be justified\r\nby certain arguments
    as to the health of society and the preservation\r\nof property, but no person
    wishes under any circumstances to hale a wise\r\nman to prison. They were further
    distressed by the knowledge that they\r\nwere in the very centre of a populous
    fairy country, and that on every\r\nside the elemental hosts might be ranging,
    ready to fall upon them with\r\nthe terrors of war or the still more awful scourge
    of their humour.\r\nThe path leading to their station was a long one, winding
    through great\r\nalleys of trees, which in some places overhung the road so thickly
    that\r\neven the full moon could not search out that deep blackness. In the\r\ndaylight
    these men would have arrested an Archangel and, if necessary,\r\nbludgeoned him,
    but in the night-time a thousand fears afflicted and a\r\nmultitude of sounds
    shocked them from every quarter.\r\n\r\nTwo men were holding the Philosopher,
    one on either side; the other two\r\nwalked one before and one behind him. In
    this order they were proceeding\r\nwhen just in front through the dim light they
    saw the road swallowed\r\nup by one of these groves already spoken of. When they
    came nigh they\r\nhalted irresolutely: the man who was in front (a silent and
    perturbed\r\nsergeant) turned fiercely to the others \u201CCome on, can\u2019t
    you?\u201D said he;\r\n\u201Cwhat the devil are you waiting for?\u201D and he
    strode forward into the\r\nblack gape.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep a good hold of that
    man,\u201D said the one behind.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be talking out of you,\u201D
    replied he on the right. \u201CHaven\u2019t we got\r\na good grip of him, and
    isn\u2019t he an old man into the bargain?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, keep a good
    tight grip of him, anyhow, for if he gave you the\r\nslip in there he\u2019d
    vanish like a weasel in a bush. Them old fellows do\r\nbe slippery customers.
    Look here, mister,\u201D said he to the Philosopher,\r\n\u201Cif you try to run
    away from us I\u2019ll give you a clout on the head with\r\nmy baton; do you
    mind me now!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey had taken only a few paces forward when the sound
    of hasty\r\nfootsteps brought them again to a halt, and in a moment the sergeant\r\ncame
    striding back. He was angry.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you going to stay there the whole
    night, or what are you going to\r\ndo at all?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet
    you be quiet now,\u201D said another; \u201Cwe were only settling with the\r\nman
    here the way he wouldn\u2019t try to give us the slip in a dark place.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    it thinking of giving us the slip he is?\u201D said the sergeant. \u201CTake\r\nyour
    baton in your hand, Shawn, and if he turns his head to one side of\r\nhim hit
    him on that side.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do that,\u201D said Shawn, and
    he pulled out his truncheon.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher had been dazed by the suddenness
    of these occurrences,\r\nand the enforced rapidity of his movements prevented
    him from either\r\nthinking or speaking, but during this brief stoppage his scattered\r\nwits
    began to return to their allegiance. First, bewilderment at his\r\nenforcement
    had seized him, and the four men, who were continually\r\nrunning round him and
    speaking all at once, and each pulling him in a\r\ndifferent direction, gave
    him the impression that he was surrounded by\r\na great rabble of people, but
    he could not discover what they wanted.\r\nAfter a time he found that there were
    only four men, and gathered from\r\ntheir remarks that he was being arrested
    for murder--this precipitated\r\nhim into another and a deeper gulf of bewilderment.
    He was unable to\r\nconceive why they should arrest him for murder when he had
    not committed\r\nany; and, following this, he became indignant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will not go another step,\u201D said he, \u201Cunless you tell me where you are\r\nbringing
    me and what I am accused of.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell me,\u201D said the sergeant,
    \u201Cwhat did you kill them with? for it\u2019s a\r\nmiracle how they came to
    their ends without as much as a mark on their\r\nskins or a broken tooth itself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho
    are you talking about?\u201D the Philosopher demanded.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    mighty innocent you are,\u201D he replied. \u201CWho would I be talking\r\nabout
    but the man and woman that used to be living with you beyond in\r\nthe little
    house? Is it poison you gave them now, or what was it? Take a\r\nhold of your
    note-book, Shawn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan\u2019t you have sense, man?\u201D said
    Shawn. \u201CHow would I be writing in the\r\nmiddle of a dark place and me without
    as much as a pencil, let alone a\r\nbook?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, we\u2019ll
    take it down at the station, and himself can tell us\r\nall about it as we go
    along. Move on now, for this is no place to be\r\nconversing in.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey
    paced on again, and in another moment they were swallowed up by\r\nthe darkness.
    When they had proceeded for a little distance there came a\r\npeculiar sound
    in front like the breathing of some enormous animal, and\r\nalso a kind of shuffling
    noise, and so they again halted.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a queer kind of a
    thing in front of us,\u201D said one of the men in\r\na low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf
    I had a match itself,\u201D said another.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant had also halted.\r\n\r\n\u201CDraw
    well into the side of the road,\u201D said he, \u201Cand poke your batons in\r\nfront
    of you. Keep a tight hold of that man, Shawn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll do
    that,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\nJust then one of them found a few matches in his
    pocket, and he struck a\r\nlight; there was no wind, so that it blazed easily
    enough, and they all\r\npeered in front. A big black cart-horse was lying in
    the middle of the\r\nroad having a gentle sleep, and when the light shone it
    scrambled to its\r\nfeet and went thundering away in a panic.\r\n\r\n\u201CIsn\u2019t
    that enough to put the heart crossways in you?\u201D said one of the\r\nmen,
    with a great sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201CAy,\u201D said another; \u201Cif you stepped
    on that beast in the darkness you\r\nwouldn\u2019t know what to be thinking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t quite remember the way about here,\u201D said the sergeant after a\r\nwhile,
    \u201Cbut I think we should take the first turn to the right. I wonder\r\nhave
    we passed the turn yet; these criss-cross kinds of roads are the\r\ndevil, and
    it dark as well. Do any of you men know the way?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t,\u201D
    said one voice; \u201CI\u2019m a Cavan man myself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRoscommon,\u201D
    said another, \u201Cis my country, and I wish I was there now,\r\nso I do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,
    if we walk straight on we\u2019re bound to get somewhere, so step it\r\nout.
    Have you got a good hold of that man, Shawn?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have so,\u201D
    said Shawn.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher\u2019s voice came pealing through the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    is no need to pinch me, sir,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not pinching
    you at all,\u201D said the man.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are so,\u201D returned the Philosopher.
    \u201CYou have a big lump of skin\r\ndoubled up in the sleeve of my coat, and
    unless you instantly release it\r\nI will sit down in the road.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    that any better?\u201D said the man, relaxing his hold a little.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    have only let out half of it,\u201D replied the Philosopher. \u201CThat\u2019s\r\nbetter
    now,\u201D he continued, and they resumed their journey.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes
    of silence the Philosopher began to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not see any necessity
    in nature for policemen,\u201D said he, \u201Cnor do I\r\nunderstand how the
    custom first originated. Dogs and cats do not employ\r\nthese extraordinary mercenaries,
    and yet their polity is progressive\r\nand orderly. Crows are a gregarious race
    with settled habitations and an\r\norganized commonwealth. They usually congregate
    in a ruined tower or on\r\nthe top of a church, and their civilization is based
    on mutual aid and\r\ntolerance for each other\u2019s idiosyncrasies. Their exceeding
    mobility and\r\nhardiness renders them dangerous to attack, and thus they are
    free to\r\ndevote themselves to the development of their domestic laws and customs.\r\nIf
    policemen were necessary to a civilization crows would certainly\r\nhave evolved
    them, but I triumphantly insist that they have not got any\r\npolicemen in their
    republic--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand a word you are saying,\u201D
    said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D said the Philosopher.
    \u201CAnts and bees also live in\r\nspecialized communities and have an extreme
    complexity both of function\r\nand occupation. Their experience in governmental
    matters is enormous,\r\nand yet they have never discovered that a police force
    is at all\r\nessential to their wellbeing--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you know,\u201D
    said the sergeant, \u201Cthat whatever you say now will be\r\nused in evidence
    against you later on?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not,\u201D said the Philosopher.
    \u201CIt may be said that these races are\r\nfree from crime, that such vices
    as they have are organized and communal\r\ninstead of individual and anarchistic,
    and that, consequently, there\r\nis no necessity for policecraft, but I cannot
    believe that these large\r\naggregations of people could have attained their
    present high culture\r\nwithout an interval of both national and individual dishonesty--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell
    me now, as you are talking,\u201D said the sergeant, \u201Cdid you buy the\r\npoison
    at a chemist\u2019s shop, or did you smother the pair of them with a\r\npillow?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    did not,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CIf crime is a condition precedent
    to\r\nthe evolution of policemen, then I will submit that jackdaws are a very\r\nthievish
    clan--they are somewhat larger than a blackbird, and will\r\nsteal wool off a
    sheep\u2019s back to line their nests with; they have,\r\nfurthermore, been known
    to abstract one shilling in copper and secrete\r\nthis booty so ingeniously that
    it has never since been recovered--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI had a jackdaw myself,\u201D
    said one of the men. \u201CI got it from a woman\r\nthat came to the door with
    a basket for fourpence. My mother stood on\r\nits back one day, and she getting
    out of bed. I split its tongue with\r\na threepenny bit the way it would talk,
    but devil the word it ever said\r\nfor me. It used to hop around letting on it
    had a lame leg, and then it\r\nwould steal your socks.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShut
    up!\u201D roared the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cthese
    people steal both from from sheep and\r\nfrom men, if their peculations range
    from wool to money, I do not\r\nsee how they can avoid stealing from each other,
    and consequently, if\r\nanywhere, it is amongst jackdaws one should look for
    the growth of a\r\npolice force, but there is no such force in existence. The
    real reason\r\nis that they are a witty and thoughtful race who look temperately
    on\r\nwhat is known as crime and evil--one eats, one steals; it is all in the\r\norder
    of things, and therefore not to be quarrelled with. There is no\r\nother view
    possible to a philosophical people--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat the devil is he
    talking about?\u201D said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CMonkeys are gregarious and
    thievish and semi-human. They inhabit the\r\nequatorial latitudes and eat nuts--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo
    you know what he is saying, Shawn?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI do not,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201C--they
    ought to have evolved professional thief-takers, but it is common\r\nknowledge
    that they have not done so. Fishes, squirrels, rats, beavers,\r\nand bison have
    also abstained from this singular growth--therefore,\r\nwhen I insist that I
    see no necessity for policemen and object to their\r\npresence, I base that objection
    on logic and facts, and not on any\r\nimmediate petty prejudice.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShawn,\u201D
    said the sergeant, \u201Chave you got a good grip on that man?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    have,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, if he talks any more hit him with
    your baton.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will so,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s
    a speck of light down yonder, and, maybe, it\u2019s a candle in a\r\nwindow--we\u2019ll
    ask the way at that place.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn about three minutes they came to a
    small house which was overhung\r\nby trees. If the light had not been visible
    they would undoubtedly have\r\npassed it in the darkness. As they approached
    the door the sound of a\r\nfemale voice came to them scoldingly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s
    somebody up anyhow,\u201D said the sergeant, and he tapped at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe
    scolding voice ceased instantly. After a few seconds he tapped\r\nagain; then
    a voice was heard from just behind the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CTomas,\u201D said the
    voice, \u201Cgo and bring up the two dogs with you before I\r\ntake the door
    off the chain.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe door was then opened a few inches and a face
    peered out \u201CWhat would\r\nyou be wanting at this hour of the night?\u201D
    said the woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot much, ma\u2019am,\u201D said the sergeant; \u201Conly
    a little direction about the\r\nroad, for we are not sure whether we\u2019ve
    gone too far or not far enough.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe woman noticed their uniforms.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    it policemen ye are? There\u2019s no harm in your coming in, I suppose,\r\nand
    if a drink of milk is any good to ye I have plenty of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMilk\u2019s
    better than nothing,\u201D said the sergeant with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve
    a little sup of spirits,\u201D said she, \u201Cbut it wouldn\u2019t be enough
    to\r\ngo around.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, well,\u201D said he, looking sternly
    at his comrades, \u201Ceverybody has to\r\ntake their chance in this world,\u201D
    and he stepped into the house followed\r\nby his men.\r\n\r\nThe women gave him
    a little sup of whisky from a bottle, and to each of\r\nthe other men she gave
    a cup of milk.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019ll wash the dust out of our gullets, anyhow,\u201D
    said one of them.\r\n\r\nThere were two chairs, a bed, and a table in the room.
    The Philosopher\r\nand his attendants sat on the bed. The sergeant sat on the
    table,\r\nthe fourth man took a chair, and the woman dropped wearily into the\r\nremaining
    chair from which she looked with pity at the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat are
    you taking the poor man away for?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a bad
    one, ma\u2019am,\u201D said the sergeant. \u201CHe killed a man and a woman\r\nthat
    were staying with him and he buried their corpses underneath the\r\nhearthstone
    of his house. He\u2019s a real malefactor, mind you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it
    hanging him you\u2019ll be, God help us?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou never know, and
    I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised if it came to\r\nthat. But you were in trouble
    yourself, ma\u2019am, for we heard your voice\r\nlamenting about something as
    we came along the road.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI was, indeed,\u201D she replied,
    \u201Cfor the person that has a son in her\r\nhouse has a trouble in her heart.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDo
    you tell me now--What did he do on you?\u201D and the sergeant bent a\r\nlook
    of grave reprobation on a young lad who was standing against the\r\nwall between
    two dogs.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe\u2019s a good boy enough in some ways,\u201D said she,
    \u201Cbut he\u2019s too fond\r\nof beasts. He\u2019ll go and lie in the kennel
    along with them two dogs for\r\nhours at a time, petting them and making a lot
    of them, but if I try\r\nto give him a kiss, or to hug him for a couple of minutes
    when I do be\r\ntired after the work, he\u2019ll wriggle like an eel till I let
    him out--it\r\nwould make a body hate him, so it would. Sure, there\u2019s no
    nature in him,\r\nsir, and I\u2019m his mother.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought
    to be ashamed of yourself, you young whelp,\u201D said the\r\nsergeant very severely.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd
    then there\u2019s the horse,\u201D she continued. \u201CMaybe you met it down
    the\r\nroad a while ago?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe did, ma\u2019am,\u201D said the
    sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, when he came in Tomas went to tie him up, for he\u2019s
    a caution at\r\ngetting out and wandering about the road, the way you\u2019d
    break your neck\r\nover him if you weren\u2019t minding. After a while I told
    the boy to come\r\nin, but he didn\u2019t come, so I went out myself, and there
    was himself and\r\nthe horse with their arms round each other\u2019s necks looking
    as if they\r\nwere moonstruck.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFaith, he\u2019s the queer
    lad!\u201D said the sergeant. \u201CWhat do you be making\r\nlove to the horse
    for, Tomas?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was all I could do to make him come in,\u201D
    she continued, \u201Cand then I\r\nsaid to him, \u2018Sit down alongside of me
    here, Tomas, and keep me company\r\nfor a little while\u2019--for I do be lonely
    in the night-time--but he\r\nwouldn\u2019t stay quiet at all. One minute he\u2019d
    say, \u2018Mother, there\u2019s a moth\r\nflying round the candle and it\u2019ll
    be burnt,\u2019 and then, \u2018There was a fly\r\ngoing into the spider\u2019s
    web in the corner,\u2019 and he\u2019d have to save\r\nit, and after that, \u2018There\u2019s
    a daddy-long-legs hurting himself on the\r\nwindow-pane,\u2019 and he\u2019d
    have to let it out; but when I try to kiss him he\r\npushes me away. My heart
    is tormented, so it is, for what have I in the\r\nworld but him?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    his father dead, ma\u2019am?\u201D said the sergeant kindly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll
    tell the truth,\u201D said she. \u201CI don\u2019t know whether he is or not,
    for\r\na long time ago, when we used to live in the city of Bla\u2019 Cliah,
    he lost\r\nhis work one time and he never came back to me again. He was ashamed
    to\r\ncome home I\u2019m thinking, the poor man, because he had no money; as
    if\r\nI would have minded whether he had any money or not--sure, he was very\r\nfond
    of me, sir, and we could have pulled along somehow. After that I\r\ncame back
    to my father\u2019s place here; the rest of the children died on\r\nme, and then
    my father died, and I\u2019m doing the best I can by myself.\r\nIt\u2019s only
    that I\u2019m a little bit troubled with the boy now and again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    a hard case, ma\u2019am,\u201D said the sergeant, \u201Cbut maybe the boy is
    only\r\na bit wild not having his father over him, and maybe it\u2019s just that
    he\u2019s\r\nused to yourself, for there isn\u2019t a child at all that doesn\u2019t
    love his\r\nmother. Let you behave yourself now, Tomas; attend to your mother,
    and\r\nleave the beasts and the insects alone, like a decent boy, for there\u2019s\r\nno
    insect in the world will ever like you as well as she does. Could you\r\ntell
    me, ma\u2019am, if we have passed the first turn on this road, or is it\r\nin
    front of us still, for we are lost altogether in the darkness?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    in front of you still,\u201D she replied, \u201Cabout ten minutes down the\r\nroad;
    you can\u2019t miss it, for you\u2019ll see the sky where there is a gap in\r\nthe
    trees, and that gap is the turn you want.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201D
    said the sergeant; \u201Cwe\u2019d better be moving on, for\r\nthere\u2019s a
    long tramp in front of us before we get to sleep this night.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    stood up and the men rose to follow him when, suddenly, the boy spoke\r\nin a
    whisper.\r\n\r\n\u201CMother,\u201D said he, \u201Cthey are going to hang the
    man,\u201D and he burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, hush, hush,\u201D said
    the woman, \u201Csure, the men can\u2019t help it.\u201D She\r\ndropped quickly
    on her knees and opened her arms, \u201CCome over to your\r\nmother, my darling.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    boy ran to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey are going to hang him,\u201D he cried in a
    high, thin voice, and he\r\nplucked at her arm violently.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, then,
    my young boy-o,\u201D said the sergeant, \u201Cnone of that violence.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    boy turned suddenly and flew at him with astonishing ferocity. He\r\nhurled himself
    against the sergeant\u2019s legs and bit, and kicked, and\r\nstruck at him. So
    furiously sudden was his attack that the man went\r\nstaggering back against
    the wall, then he plucked at the boy and whirled\r\nhim across the room. In an
    instant the two dogs leaped at him snarling\r\nwith rage--one of these he kicked
    into a corner, from which it rebounded\r\nagain bristling and red-eyed; the other
    dog was caught by the woman,\r\nand after a few frantic seconds she gripped the
    first dog also. To a\r\nhorrible chorus of howls and snapping teeth the men hustled
    outside and\r\nslammed the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CShawn,\u201D the sergeant bawled,
    \u201Chave you got a good grip of that man?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have so,\u201D
    said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf he gets away I\u2019ll kick the belly out of you;
    mind that now! Come\r\nalong with you and no more of your slouching.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey
    marched down the road in a tingling silence.\r\n\r\n\u201CDogs,\u201D said the
    Philosopher, \u201Care a most intelligent race of people--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople,
    my granny!\u201D said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CFrom the earliest ages their
    intelligence has been observed and\r\nrecorded, so that ancient literatures are
    bulky with references to their\r\nsagacity and fidelity--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWill
    you shut your old jaw?\u201D said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not,\u201D
    said the Philosopher. \u201CElephants also are credited with an\r\nextreme intelligence
    and devotion to their masters, and they will build\r\na wall or nurse a baby
    with equal skill and happiness. Horses have\r\nreceived high recommendations
    in this respect, but crocodiles, hens,\r\nbeetles, armadillos, and fish do not
    evince any remarkable partiality\r\nfor man--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish,\u201D
    said the sergeant bitterly, \u201Cthat all them beasts were stuffed\r\ndown your
    throttle the way you\u2019d have to hold your prate.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t
    matter,\u201D said the Philosopher. \u201CI do not know why these\r\nanimals
    should attach themselves to men with gentleness and love and yet\r\nbe able to
    preserve intact their initial bloodthirstiness, so that while\r\nthey will allow
    their masters to misuse them in any way they will yet\r\nfight most willingly
    with each other, and are never really happy saving\r\nin the conduct of some
    private and nonsensical battle of their own. I do\r\nnot believe that it is fear
    which tames these creatures into mildness,\r\nbut that the most savage animal
    has a capacity for love which has not\r\nbeen sufficiently noted, and which,
    if more intelligent attention\r\nhad been directed upon it, would have raised
    them to the status of\r\nintellectual animals as against intelligent ones, and,
    perhaps, have\r\nopened to us a correspondence which could not have been other
    than\r\nbeneficial.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep your eyes out for that gap in the
    trees, Shawn,\u201D said the\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m doing that,\u201D
    said Shawn.\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher continued:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy can I not exchange
    ideas with a cow? I am amazed at the\r\nincompleteness of my growth when I and
    a fellow-creature stand dumbly\r\nbefore each other without one glimmer of comprehension,
    locked and\r\nbarred from all friendship and intercourse--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShawn,\u201D
    cried the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t interrupt,\u201D said the Philosopher;
    \u201Cyou are always talking.--The\r\nlower animals, as they are foolishly called,
    have abilities at which we\r\ncan only wonder. The mind of an ant is one to which
    I would readily go\r\nto school. Birds have atmospheric and levitational information
    which\r\nmillions of years will not render accessible to us; who that has seen
    a\r\nspider weaving his labyrinth, or a bee voyaging safely in the trackless\r\nair,
    can refuse to credit that a vivid, trained intelligence animates\r\nthese small
    enigmas? and the commonest earthworm is the heir to a\r\nculture before which
    I bow with the profoundest veneration--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShawn,\u201D said
    the sergeant, \u201Csay something for goodness\u2019 sake to take\r\nthe sound
    of that man\u2019s clack out of my ear.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t know
    what to be talking about,\u201D said Shawn, \u201Cfor I never\r\nwas much of
    a hand at conversation, and, barring my prayers, I got no\r\neducation--I think
    myself that he was making a remark about a dog. Did\r\nyou ever own a dog, sergeant?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    are doing very well, Shawn,\u201D said the sergeant, \u201Ckeep it up now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    knew a man had a dog would count up to a hundred for you. He won lots\r\nof money
    in bets about it, and he\u2019d have made a fortune, only that I\r\nnoticed one
    day he used to be winking at the dog, and when he\u2019d stop\r\nwinking the
    dog would stop counting. We made him turn his back after\r\nthat, and got the
    dog to count sixpence, but he barked for more than\r\nfive shillings, he did
    so, and he would have counted up to a pound,\r\nmaybe, only that his master turned
    round and hit him a kick. Every\r\nperson that ever paid him a bet said they
    wanted their money back, but\r\nthe man went away to America in the night, and
    I expect he\u2019s doing well\r\nthere for he took the dog with him. It was a
    wire-haired terrier bitch,\r\nand it was the devil for having pups.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
    is astonishing,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Con what slender compulsion\r\npeople
    will go to America--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep it up, Shawn,\u201D said the sergeant,
    \u201Cyou are doing me a favour.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will so,\u201D said Shawn.
    \u201CI had a cat one time and it used to have\r\nkittens every two months.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher\u2019s voice arose:\r\n\r\n\u201CIf there was any periodicity about
    these migrations one could\r\nunderstand them. Birds, for example, migrate from
    their homes in the\r\nlate autumn and seek abroad the sustenance and warmth which
    the winter\r\nwould withhold if they remained in their native lands. The salmon
    also,\r\na dignified fish with a pink skin, emigrates from the Atlantic\r\nOcean,
    and betakes himself inland to the streams and lakes, where he\r\nrecuperates
    for a season, and is often surprised by net, angle, or\r\nspear--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCut
    in now, Shawn,\u201D said the sergeant anxiously.\r\n\r\nShawn began to gabble
    with amazing speed and in a mighty voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CCats sometimes eat their
    kittens, and sometimes they don\u2019t. A cat that\r\neats its kittens is a heartless
    brute. I knew a cat used to eat its\r\nkittens--it had four legs and a long tail,
    and it used to get the\r\nhead-staggers every time it had eaten its kittens.
    I killed it myself\r\none day with a hammer for I couldn\u2019t stand the smell
    it made, so I\r\ncouldn\u2019t--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShawn,\u201D said the sergeant,
    \u201Ccan\u2019t you talk about something else besides\r\ncats and dogs?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSure,
    I don\u2019t know what to talk about,\u201D said Shawn. \u201CI\u2019m sweating
    this\r\nminute trying to please you, so I arm. If you\u2019ll tell me what to
    talk\r\nabout I\u2019ll do my endeavours.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re a fool,\u201D
    said the sergeant sorrowfully; \u201Cyou\u2019ll never make a\r\nconstable. I\u2019m
    thinking that I would sooner listen to the man himself\r\nthan to you. Have you
    got a good hold of him now?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have so,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,
    step out and maybe we\u2019ll reach the barracks this night, unless\r\nthis is
    a road that there isn\u2019t any end to at all. What was that? Did\r\nyou hear
    a noise?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t hear a thing,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    thought,\u201D said another man, \u201Cthat I heard something moving in the\r\nhedge
    at the side of the road.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s what I heard,\u201D said
    the sergeant. \u201CMaybe it was a weasel. I wish\r\nto the devil that we were
    out of this place where you can\u2019t see as much\r\nas your own nose. Now did
    you hear it, Shawn?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did so,\u201D said Shawn; \u201Cthere\u2019s
    some one in the hedge, for a weasel\r\nwould make a different kind of a noise
    if it made any at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep together, men,\u201D said the
    sergeant, \u201Cand march on; if there\u2019s\r\nanybody about they\u2019ve no
    business with us.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken when there came a sudden
    pattering of feet, and\r\nimmediately the four men were surrounded and were being
    struck at on\r\nevery side with sticks and hands and feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CDraw
    your batons,\u201D the sergeant roared; \u201Ckeep a good grip of that man,\r\nShawn.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will so,\u201D said Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand round him, you other men, and hit
    anything that comes near you.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was no sound of voices from
    the assailants, only a rapid scuffle\r\nof feet, the whistle of sticks as they
    swung through the air or slapped\r\nsmartly against a body or clashed upon each
    other, and the quick\r\nbreathing of many people; but from the four policemen
    there came noise\r\nand to spare as they struck wildly on every side, cursing
    the darkness\r\nand their opposers with fierce enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet out,\u201D
    cried Shawn suddenly. \u201CLet out or I\u2019ll smash your nut for\r\nyou. There\u2019s
    some one pulling at the prisoner, and I\u2019ve dropped my\r\nbaton.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    truncheons of the policemen had been so ferociously exercised that\r\ntheir antagonists
    departed as swiftly and as mysteriously as they came.\r\nIt was just two minutes
    of frantic, aimless conflict, and then the\r\nsilent night was round them again,
    without any sound but the slow\r\ncreaking of branches, the swish of leaves as
    they swung and poised, and\r\nthe quiet croon of the wind along the road.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome
    on, men,\u201D said the sergeant, \u201Cwe\u2019d better be getting out of this\r\nplace
    as quick as we can. Are any of ye hurted?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve got one
    of the enemy,\u201D said Shawn, panting.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got what?\u201D
    said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve got one of them, and he is wriggling
    like an eel on a pan.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHold him tight,\u201D said the sergeant
    excitedly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will so,\u201D said Shawn. \u201CIt\u2019s a little
    one by the feel of it. If one\r\nof ye would hold the prisoner, I\u2019d get
    a better grip on this one. Aren\u2019t\r\nthey dangerous villains now?\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother
    man took hold of the Philosopher\u2019s arm, and Shawn got both hands\r\non his
    captive.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep quiet, I\u2019m telling you,\u201D said he, \u201Cor
    I\u2019ll throttle you, I will\r\nso. Faith, it seems like a little boy by the
    feel of it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA little boy!\u201D said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,
    he doesn\u2019t reach up to my waist.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must be the young
    brat from the cottage that set the dogs on us, the\r\none that loves beasts.
    Now then, boy, what do you mean by this kind of\r\nthing? You\u2019ll find yourself
    in gaol for this, my young buck-o. Who was\r\nwith you, eh? Tell me that now?\u201D
    and the sergeant bent forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold up your head, sonny, and talk
    to the sergeant,\u201D said Shawn. \u201COh!\u201D\r\n he roared, and suddenly
    he made a little rush forward. \u201CI\u2019ve got him,\u201D\r\n he gasped;
    \u201Che nearly got away. It isn\u2019t a boy at all, sergeant; there\u2019s\r\nwhiskers
    on it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you say?\u201D said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    put my hand under its chin and there\u2019s whiskers on it. I nearly let\r\nhim
    out with the surprise, I did so.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTry again,\u201D said the
    sergeant in a low voice; \u201Cyou are making a\r\nmistake.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t like touching them,\u201D said Shawn. \u201CIt\u2019s a soft whisker
    like a\r\nbilly-goat\u2019s. Maybe you\u2019d try yourself, sergeant, for I tell
    you I\u2019m\r\nfrightened of it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHold him over here,\u201D
    said the sergeant, \u201Cand keep a good grip of him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll
    do that,\u201D said Shawn, and he hauled some reluctant object towards\r\nhis
    superior.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant put out his hand and touched a head.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    only a boy\u2019s size to be sure,\u201D said he, then he slid his hand down\r\nthe
    face and withdrew it quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are whiskers on it,\u201D said
    he soberly. \u201CWhat the devil can it be?\r\nI never met whiskers so near the
    ground before. Maybe they are false\r\nones, and it\u2019s just the boy yonder
    trying to disguise himself.\u201D He put\r\nout his hand again with an effort,
    felt his way to the chin, and tugged.\r\n\r\nInstantly there came a yell, so
    loud, so sudden, that every man of them\r\njumped in a panic.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    are real whiskers,\u201D said the sergeant with a sigh. \u201CI wish I knew\r\nwhat
    it is. His voice is big enough for two men, and that\u2019s a fact. Have\r\nyou
    got another match on you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have two more in my waistcoat
    pocket,\u201D said one of the men.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me one of them,\u201D said
    the sergeant; \u201CI\u2019ll strike it myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe groped about
    until he found the hand with the match.\r\n\r\n\u201CBe sure and hold him tight,
    Shawn, the way we can have a good look at\r\nhim, for this is like to be a queer
    miracle of a thing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m holding him by the two arms,\u201D
    said Shawn, \u201Che can\u2019t stir anything\r\nbut his head, and I\u2019ve
    got my chest on that.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sergeant struck the match, shading it
    for a moment with his hand,\r\nthen he turned it on their new prisoner.\r\n\r\nThey
    saw a little man dressed in tight green clothes; he had a broad\r\npale face
    with staring eyes, and there was a thin fringe of grey whisker\r\nunder his chin--then
    the match went out.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a Leprecaun,\u201D said the sergeant.\r\n\r\nThe
    men were silent for a full couple of minutes-at last Shawn spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo
    you tell me so?\u201D said he in a musing voice; \u201Cthat\u2019s a queer miracle\r\naltogether.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do,\u201D said the sergeant. \u201CDoesn\u2019t it stand to reason that it can\u2019t
    be\r\nanything else? You saw it yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nShawn plumped down on
    his knees before his captive.\r\n\r\n\u201CTell me where the money is?\u201D
    he hissed. \u201CTell me where the money is or\r\nI\u2019ll twist your neck off.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    other men also gathered eagerly around, shouting threats and\r\ncommands at the
    Leprecaun.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold your whist,\u201D said Shawn fiercely to them. \u201CHe
    can\u2019t answer the\r\nlot of you, can he?\u201D and he turned again to the
    Leprecaun and shook him\r\nuntil his teeth chattered.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you don\u2019t
    tell me where the money is at once I\u2019ll kill you, I will\r\nso.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    haven\u2019t got any money at all, sir,\u201D said the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\n\u201CNone
    of your lies,\u201D roared Shawn. \u201CTell the truth now or it\u2019ll be worse\r\nfor
    you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t got any money,\u201D said the Leprecaun,
    \u201Cfor Meehawl MacMurrachu\r\nof the Hill stole our crock a while back, and
    he buried it under a thorn\r\nbush. I can bring you to the place if you don\u2019t
    believe me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CVery good,\u201D said Shawn. \u201CCome on with
    me now, and I\u2019ll clout you if you\r\nas much as wriggle; do you mind me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat
    would I wriggle for?\u201D said the Leprecaun: \u201Csure I like being with\r\nyou.\u201D\r\n\r\nHereupon
    the sergeant roared at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CAttention,\u201D said
    he, and the men leaped to position like automata.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it you
    are going to do with your prisoner, Shawn?\u201D said he\r\nsarcastically. \u201CDon\u2019t
    you think we\u2019ve had enough tramping of these roads\r\nfor one night, now?
    Bring up that Leprecaun to the barracks or it\u2019ll be\r\nthe worse for you--do
    you hear me talking to you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the gold, sergeant,\u201D
    said Shawn sulkily.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf there\u2019s any gold it\u2019ll be treasure
    trove, and belong to the Crown.\r\nWhat kind of a constable are you at all, Shawn?
    Mind what you are about\r\nnow, my man, and no back answers. Step along there.
    Bring that murderer\r\nup at once, whichever of you has him.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere
    came a gasp from the darkness.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Oh, Oh!\u201D said a voice of
    horror.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201D said the sergeant: \u201Care
    you hurted?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe prisoner!\u201D he gasped, \u201Che, he\u2019s
    got away!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGot away?\u201D and the sergeant\u2019s voice was
    a blare of fury.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhile we were looking at the Leprecaun,\u201D said
    the voice of woe, \u201CI must\r\nhave forgotten about the other one--I, I haven\u2019t
    got him--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou gawm!\u201D gritted the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs
    it my prisoner that\u2019s gone?\u201D said Shawn in a deep voice. He leaped\r\nforward
    with a curse and smote his negligent comrade so terrible a blow\r\nin the face,
    that the man went flying backwards, and the thud of his\r\nhead on the road could
    have been heard anywhere.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet up,\u201D said Shawn, \u201Cget up
    till I give you another one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat will do,\u201D said the
    sergeant, \u201Cwe\u2019ll go home. We\u2019re the\r\nlaughing-stock of the world.
    I\u2019ll pay you out for this some time, every\r\ndamn man of ye. Bring that
    Leprecaun along with you, and quick march.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh!\u201D said
    Shawn in a strangled tone.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is it now?\u201D said the sergeant
    testily.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D replied Shawn.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did you
    say \u2018Oh!\u2019 for then, you block-head?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the
    Leprecaun, sergeant,\u201D said Shawn in a whisper--\u201Che\u2019s got\r\naway--when
    I was hitting the man there I forgot all about the Leprecaun:\r\nhe must have
    run into the hedge. Oh, sergeant, dear, don\u2019t say anything\r\nto me now--!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CQuick
    march,\u201D said the sergeant, and the four men moved on through the\r\ndarkness
    in a silence, which was only skin deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nBY reason
    of the many years which he had spent in the gloomy pine wood,\r\nthe Philosopher
    could see a little in the darkness, and when he found\r\nthere was no longer
    any hold on his coat he continued his journey\r\nquietly, marching along with
    his head sunken on his breast in a deep\r\nabstraction. He was meditating on
    the word \u201CMe,\u201D and endeavouring to\r\npursue it through all its changes
    and adventures. The fact of \u201Cme-ness\u201D\r\n was one which startled him.
    He was amazed at his own being. He knew that\r\nthe hand which he held up and
    pinched with another hand was not him\r\nand the endeavour to find out what was
    him was one which had frequently\r\nexercised his leisure. He had not gone far
    when there came a tug at\r\nhis sleeve and looking down he found one of the Leprecauns
    of the Gort\r\ntrotting by his side.\r\n\r\n\u201CNoble Sir,\u201D said the Leprecaun,
    \u201Cyou are terrible hard to get into\r\nconversation with. I have been talking
    to you for the last long time and\r\nyou won\u2019t listen.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am listening now,\u201D replied the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are, indeed,\u201D
    said the Leprecaun heartily. \u201CMy brothers are on the\r\nother side of the
    road over there beyond the hedge, and they want to\r\ntalk to you: will you come
    with me, Noble Sir?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy wouldn\u2019t I go with you?\u201D
    said the Philosopher, and he turned aside\r\nwith the Leprecaun.\r\n\r\nThey
    pushed softly through a gap in the hedge and into a field beyond.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome
    this way, sir,\u201D said his guide, and the Philosopher followed him\r\nacross
    the field. In a few minutes they came to a thick bush among the\r\nleaves of
    which the other Leprecauns were hiding. They thronged out to\r\nmeet the Philosopher\u2019s
    approach and welcomed him with every appearance\r\nof joy. With them was the
    Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, who embraced her\r\nhusband tenderly and gave thanks
    for his escape.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe night is young yet,\u201D remarked one of the
    Leprecauns. \u201CLet us sit\r\ndown here and talk about what should be done.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am tired enough,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cfor I have been travelling\r\nall
    yesterday, and all this day and the whole of this night I have been\r\ngoing
    also, so I would be glad to sit down anywhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey sat down under
    the bush and the Philosopher lit his pipe. In the\r\nopen space where they were
    there was just light enough to see the smoke\r\ncoming from his pipe, but scarcely
    more. One recognized a figure as a\r\ndeeper shadow than the surrounding darkness;
    but as the ground was dry\r\nand the air just touched with a pleasant chill,
    there was no discomfort.\r\nAfter the Philosopher had drawn a few mouthfuls of
    smoke he passed his\r\npipe on to the next person, and in this way his pipe made
    the circuit of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I put the children to bed,\u201D
    said the Thin Woman, \u201CI came down the\r\nroad in your wake with a basin
    of stirabout, for you had no time to take\r\nyour food, God help you! and I was
    thinking you must have been hungry.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is so,\u201D said
    the Philosopher in a very anxious voice: \u201Cbut I don\u2019t\r\nblame you,
    my dear, for letting the basin fall on the road--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhile I
    was going along,\u201D she continued, \u201CI met these good people and\r\nwhen
    I told them what happened they came with me to see if anything\r\ncould be done.
    The time they ran out of the hedge to fight the policemen\r\nI wanted to go with
    them, but I was afraid the stirabout would be\r\nspilt.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher
    licked his lips.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am listening to you, my love,\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo
    I had to stay where I was with the stirabout under my shawl--\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDid
    you slip then, dear wife?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not, indeed,\u201D she replied:
    \u201CI have the stirabout with me this\r\nminute. It\u2019s rather cold, I\u2019m
    thinking, but it is better than nothing at\r\nall,\u201D and she placed the bowl
    in his hands.\r\n\r\n\u201CI put sugar in it,\u201D said she shyly, \u201Cand
    currants, and I have a spoon\r\nin my pocket.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt tastes well,\u201D
    said the Philosopher, and he cleaned the basin so\r\nspeedily that his wife wept
    because of his hunger.\r\n\r\nBy this time the pipe had come round to him again
    and it was welcomed.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow we can talk,\u201D said he, and he blew
    a great cloud of smoke into the\r\ndarkness and sighed happily.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    were thinking,\u201D said the Thin Woman, \u201Cthat you won\u2019t be able to
    come\r\nback to our house for a while yet: the policemen will be peeping about\r\nCoille
    Doraca for a long time, to be sure; for isn\u2019t it true that if\r\nthere is
    a good thing coming to a person, nobody takes much trouble to\r\nfind him, but
    if there is a bad thing or a punishment in store for a\r\nman, then the whole
    world will be searched until he be found?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a true statement,\u201D
    said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo what we arranged was this--that you should
    go to live with these\r\nlittle men in their house under the yew tree of the
    Gort. There is not a\r\npoliceman in the world would find you there; or if you
    went by night to\r\nthe Brugh of the Boyne, Angus Og himself would give you a
    refuge.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne of the Leprecauns here interposed.\r\n\r\n\u201CNoble
    Sir,\u201D said he, \u201Cthere isn\u2019t much room in our house but there\u2019s
    no\r\nstint of welcome in it. You would have a good time with us travelling on\r\nmoonlit
    nights and seeing strange things, for we often go to visit the\r\nShee of the
    Hills and they come to see us; there is always something\r\nto talk about, and
    we have dances in the caves and on the tops of the\r\nhills. Don\u2019t be imagining
    now that we have a poor life for there is fun\r\nand plenty with us and the Brugh
    of Angus Mac an Og is hard to be got\r\nat.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI would like to
    dance, indeed,\u201D returned the Philosopher, \u201Cfor I do\r\nbelieve that
    dancing is the first and last duty of man. If we cannot be\r\ngay what can we
    be? Life is not any use at all unless we find a laugh\r\nhere and there--but
    this time, decent men of the Gort, I cannot go with\r\nyou, for it is laid on
    me to give myself up to the police.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou would not do that,\u201D
    exclaimed the Thin Woman pitifully: \u201CYou\r\nwouldn\u2019t think of doing
    that now!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAn innocent man,\u201D said he, \u201Ccannot be
    oppressed, for he is fortified\r\nby his mind and his heart cheers him. It is
    only on a guilty person that\r\nthe rigour of punishment can fall, for he punishes
    himself. This is what\r\nI think, that a man should always obey the law with
    his body and always\r\ndisobey it with his mind. I have been arrested, the men
    of the law had\r\nme in their hands, and I will have to go back to them so that
    they may\r\ndo whatever they have to do.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher resumed
    his pipe, and although the others reasoned with\r\nhim for a long time they could
    not by any means remove him from his\r\npurpose. So, when the pale glimmer of
    dawn had stolen over the sky,\r\nthey arose and went downwards to the cross-roads
    and so to the Police\r\nStation.\r\n\r\nOutside the village the Leprecauns bade
    him farewell and the Thin Woman\r\nalso took her leave of him, saying she would
    visit Angus Og and implore\r\nhis assistance on behalf of her husband, and then
    the Leprecauns and the\r\nThin Woman returned again the way they came, and the
    Philosopher walked\r\non to the barracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWHEN
    he knocked at the barracks door it was opened by a man with\r\ntousled, red hair,
    who looked as though he had just awakened from sleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you
    want at this hour of the night?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want to give myself
    up,\u201D said the Philosopher. The policeman looked\r\nat him \u201CA man as
    old as you are,\u201D said he, \u201Coughtn\u2019t to be a fool. Go\r\nhome now,
    I advise you, and don\u2019t say a word to any one whether you did\r\nit or not.
    Tell me this now, was it found out, or are you only making a\r\nclean breast
    of it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSure I must give myself up,\u201D said the Philosopher.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf
    you must, you must, and that\u2019s an end of it. Wipe your feet on the\r\nrail
    there and come in--I\u2019ll take your deposition.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have
    no deposition for you,\u201D said the Philosopher, \u201Cfor I didn\u2019t do
    a\r\nthing at all.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe policeman stared at him again.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf
    that\u2019s so,\u201D said he, \u201Cyou needn\u2019t come in at all, and you
    needn\u2019t\r\nhave wakened me out of my sleep either. Maybe, tho\u2019, you
    are the man\r\nthat fought the badger on the Naas Road--Eh?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    am not,\u201D replied the Philosopher: \u201Cbut I was arrested for killing my\r\nbrother
    and his wife, although I never touched them.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that who you
    are?\u201D said the policeman; and then, briskly, \u201CYou\u2019re as\r\nwelcome
    as the cuckoo, you are so. Come in and make yourself comfortable\r\ntill the
    men awaken, and they are the lads that\u2019ll be glad to see you.\r\nI couldn\u2019t
    make head or tail of what they said when they came in last\r\nnight, and no one
    else either, for they did nothing but fight each other\r\nand curse the banshees
    and cluricauns of Leinster. Sit down there on the\r\nsettle by the fire and,
    maybe, you\u2019ll be able to get a sleep; you look\r\nas if you were tired,
    and the mud of every county in Ireland is on your\r\nboots.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher thanked him and stretched out on the settle. In a short\r\ntime,
    for he was very weary, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nMany hours later he was awakened
    by the sound of voices, and found on\r\nrising, that the men who had captured
    him on the previous evening were\r\nstanding by the bed. The sergeant\u2019s
    face beamed with joy. He was dressed\r\nonly in his trousers and shirt. His hair
    was sticking up in some places\r\nand sticking out in others which gave a certain
    wild look to him, and\r\nhis feet were bare. He took the Philosopher\u2019s two
    hands in his own and\r\nswore if ever there was anything he could do to comfort
    him he would do\r\nthat and more. Shawn, in a similar state of unclothedness,
    greeted the\r\nPhilosopher and proclaimed himself his friend and follower for
    ever.\r\nShawn further announced that he did not believe the Philosopher had\r\nkilled
    the two people, that if he had killed them they must have richly\r\ndeserved
    it, and that if he was hung he would plant flowers on his\r\ngrave; for a decenter,
    quieter, and wiser man he had never met and never\r\nwould meet in the world.\r\n\r\nThese
    professions of esteem comforted the Philosopher, and he replied to\r\nthem in
    terms which made the red-haired policeman gape in astonishment\r\nand approval.\r\n\r\nHe
    was given a breakfast of bread and cocoa which he ate with his\r\nguardians,
    and then, as they had to take up their outdoor duties, he\r\nwas conducted to
    the backyard and informed he could walk about there\r\nand that he might smoke
    until he was black in the face. The policemen\r\nseverally presented him with
    a pipe, a tin of tobacco, two boxes of\r\nmatches and a dictionary, and then
    they withdrew, leaving him to his own\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nThe garden was about
    twelve feet square, having high, smooth walls on\r\nevery side, and into it there
    came neither sun nor wind. In one corner a\r\nclump of rusty-looking sweet-pea
    was climbing up the wall--every leaf\r\nof this plant was riddled with holes,
    and there were no flowers on it.\r\nAnother corner was occupied by dwarf nasturtiums,
    and on this plant,\r\nin despite of every discouragement, two flowers were blooming,
    but its\r\nleaves also were tattered and dejected. A mass of ivy clung to the
    third\r\ncorner, its leaves were big and glossy at the top, but near the ground\r\nthere
    was only grey, naked stalks laced together by cobwebs. The fourth\r\nwall was
    clothed in a loose Virginia creeper every leaf of which looked\r\nlike an insect
    that could crawl if it wanted to. The centre of this\r\nsmall plot had used every
    possible artifice to cover itself with grass,\r\nand in some places it had wonderfully
    succeeded, but the pieces of\r\nbroken bottles, shattered jampots, and sections
    of crockery were so\r\nnumerous that no attempt at growth could be other than
    tentative and\r\nunpassioned.\r\n\r\nHere, for a long time, the Philosopher marched
    up and down. At one\r\nmoment he examined the sweet-pea and mourned with it on
    a wretched\r\nexistence. Again he congratulated the nasturtium on its two bright\r\nchildren;
    but he thought of the gardens wherein they might have bloomed\r\nand the remembrance
    of that spacious, sunny freedom saddened him.\r\n\r\n\u201CIndeed, poor creatures!\u201D
    said he, \u201Cye also are in gaol.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe blank, soundless yard troubled
    him so much that at last he called to\r\nthe red-haired policeman and begged
    to be put into a cell in preference;\r\nand to the common cell he was, accordingly,
    conducted.\r\n\r\nThis place was a small cellar built beneath the level of the
    ground. An\r\niron grating at the top of the wall admitted one blanched wink
    of light,\r\nbut the place was bathed in obscurity. A wooden ladder led down
    to the\r\ncell from a hole in the ceiling, and this hole also gave a spark of\r\nbrightness
    and some little air to the room. The walls were of stone\r\ncovered with plaster,
    but the plaster had fallen away in many places\r\nleaving the rough stones visible
    at every turn of the eye.\r\n\r\nThere were two men in the cell, and these the
    Philosopher saluted; but\r\nthey did not reply, nor did they speak to each other.
    There was a low,\r\nwooden form fixed to the wall, running quite round the room,
    and on\r\nthis, far apart from each other, the two men were seated, with their\r\nelbows
    resting on their knees, their heads propped upon their hands,\r\nand each of
    them with an unwavering gaze fixed on the floor between his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe
    Philosopher walked for a time up and down the little cell, but soon\r\nhe also
    sat down on the low form, propped his head on his hands and\r\nlapsed to a melancholy
    dream.\r\n\r\nSo the day passed. Twice a policeman came down the ladder bearing
    three\r\nportions of food, bread and cocoa; and by imperceptible gradations the\r\nlight
    faded away from the grating and the darkness came. After a great\r\ninterval
    the policeman again approached carrying three mattresses and\r\nthree rough blankets,
    and these he bundled through the hole. Each of the\r\nmen took a mattress and
    a blanket and spread them on the floor, and the\r\nPhilosopher took his share
    also.\r\n\r\nBy this time they could not see each other and all their operations
    were\r\nconducted by the sense of touch alone. They laid themselves down on the\r\nbeds
    and a terrible, dark silence brooded over the room.\r\n\r\nBut the Philosopher
    could not sleep, he kept his eyes shut, for the\r\ndarkness under his eyelids
    was not so dense as that which surrounded\r\nhim; indeed, he could at will illuminate
    his own darkness and order\r\naround him the sunny roads or the sparkling sky.
    While his eyes were\r\nclosed he had the mastery of all pictures of light and
    colour and\r\nwarmth, but an irresistible fascination compelled him every few
    minutes\r\nto reopen them, and in the sad space around he could not create any\r\nhappiness.
    The darkness weighed very sadly upon him so that in a short\r\ntime it did creep
    under his eyelids and drowned his happy pictures until\r\na blackness possessed
    him both within and without \u201CCan one\u2019s mind go to\r\nprison as well
    as one\u2019s body?\u201D said he.\r\n\r\nHe strove desperately to regain his
    intellectual freedom, but he could\r\nnot. He could conjure up no visions but
    those of fear. The creatures of\r\nthe dark invaded him, fantastic terrors were
    thronging on every side:\r\nthey came from the darkness into his eyes and beyond
    into himself, so\r\nthat his mind as well as his fancy was captured, and he knew
    he was,\r\nindeed, in gaol.\r\n\r\nIt was with a great start that he heard a
    voice speaking from the\r\nsilence--a harsh, yet cultivated voice, but he could
    not imagine which\r\nof his companions was speaking. He had a vision of that
    man tormented\r\nby the mental imprisonment of the darkness, trying to get away
    from his\r\nghosts and slimy enemies, goaded into speech in his own despite lest
    he\r\nshould be submerged and finally possessed by the abysmal demons. For a\r\nwhile
    the voice spoke of the strangeness of life and the cruelty of\r\nmen to each
    other--disconnected sentences, odd words of selfpity and\r\nself-encouragement,
    and then the matter became more connected and a\r\nstory grew in the dark cell
    \u201CI knew a man,\u201D said the voice, \u201Cand he was\r\na clerk. He had
    thirty shillings a week, and for five years he had never\r\nmissed a day going
    to his work. He was a careful man, but a person with\r\na wife and four children
    cannot save much out of thirty shillings a\r\nweek. The rent of a house is high,
    a wife and children must be fed, and\r\nthey have to get boots and clothes, so
    that at the end of each week\r\nthat man\u2019s thirty shillings used to be all
    gone. But they managed to get\r\nalong somehow--the man and his wife and the
    four children were fed and\r\nclothed and educated, and the man often wondered
    how so much could\r\nbe done with so little money; but the reason was that his
    wife was a\r\ncareful woman... and then the man got sick. A poor person cannot
    afford\r\nto get sick, and a married man cannot leave his work. If he is sick\r\nhe
    has to be sick; but he must go to his work all the same, for if he\r\nstayed
    away who would pay the wages and feed his family? and when he\r\nwent back to
    work he might find that there was nothing for him to do.\r\nThis man fell sick,
    but he made no change in his way of life: he got up\r\nat the same time and went
    to the office as usual, and he got through the\r\nday somehow without attracting
    his employer\u2019s attention. He didn\u2019t know\r\nwhat was wrong with him:
    he only knew that he was sick. Sometimes he had\r\nsharp, swift pains in his
    head, and again there would be long hours of\r\nlanguor when he could scarcely
    bear to change his position or lift a\r\npen. He would commence a letter with
    the words \u2018Dear Sir,\u2019 forming the\r\nletter \u2018D\u2019 with painful,
    accurate slowness, elaborating and thickening\r\nthe up and down strokes, and
    being troubled when he had to leave that\r\nletter for the next one; he built
    the next letter by hair strokes and\r\nwould start on the third with hatred.
    The end of a word seemed to that\r\nman like the conclusion of an event--it was
    a surprising, isolated,\r\nindividual thing, having no reference to anything
    else in the world,\r\nand on starting a new word he seemed bound, in order to
    preserve its\r\nindividuality, to write it in a different handwriting. He would
    sit with\r\nhis shoulders hunched up and his pen resting on the paper, staring
    at a\r\nletter until he was nearly mesmerized, and then come to himself with
    a\r\nsense of fear, which started him working like a madman, so that he might\r\nnot
    be behind with his business. The day seemed to be so long. It rolled\r\non rusty
    hinges that could scarcely move. Each hour was like a great\r\ncircle swollen
    with heavy air, and it droned and buzzed into an\r\neternity. It seemed to the
    man that his hand in particular wanted to\r\nrest. It was luxury not to work
    with it. It was good to lay it down on\r\na sheet of paper with the pen sloping
    against his finger, and then watch\r\nhis hand going to sleep--it seemed to the
    man that it was his hand\r\nand not himself wanted to sleep, but it always awakened
    when the pen\r\nslipped. There was an instinct in him somewhere not to let the
    pen\r\nslip, and every time the pen moved his hand awakened, and began to work\r\nlanguidly.
    When he went home at night he lay down at once and stared\r\nfor hours at a fly
    on the wall or a crack on the ceiling. When his wife\r\nspoke to him he heard
    her speaking as from a great distance, and he\r\nanswered her dully as though
    he was replying through a cloud. He only\r\nwanted to be let alone, to be allowed
    to stare at the fly on the wall,\r\nor the crack on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\u201COne
    morning he found that he couldn\u2019t get up, or rather, that he didn\u2019t\r\nwant
    to get up. When his wife called him he made no reply, and she\r\nseemed to call
    him every ten seconds--the words, \u2018get up, get up,\u2019 were\r\ncrackling
    all round him; they were bursting like bombs on the right hand\r\nand on the
    left of him: they were scattering from above and all around\r\nhim, bursting
    upwards from the floor, swirling, swaying, and jostling\r\neach other. Then the
    sounds ceased, and one voice only said to him\r\n\u2018You are late!\u2019 He
    saw these words like a blur hanging in the air, just\r\nbeyond his eyelids, and
    he stared at the blur until he fell asleep.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe voice in the cell
    ceased speaking for a few minutes, and then it\r\nwent on again.\r\n\r\n\u201CFor
    three weeks the man did not leave his bed--he lived faintly in a\r\nkind of trance,
    wherein great forms moved about slowly and immense\r\nwords were drumming gently
    for ever. When he began to take notice again\r\neverything in the house was different.
    Most of the furniture, paid for\r\nso hardly, was gone. He missed a thing everywhere--chairs,
    a mirror,\r\na table: wherever he looked he missed something; and downstairs
    was\r\nworse--there, everything was gone. His wife had sold all her furniture\r\nto
    pay for doctors, for medicine, for food and rent. And she was changed\r\ntoo:
    good things had gone from her face; she was gaunt, sharp-featured,\r\nmiserable--but
    she was comforted to think he was going back to work\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    was a flurry in his head when he went to his office. He didn\u2019t\r\nknow what
    his employer would say for stopping away. He might blame him\r\nfor being sick--he
    wondered would his employer pay him for the weeks he\r\nwas absent. When he stood
    at the door he was frightened. Suddenly the\r\nthought of his master\u2019s eye
    grew terrible to him: it was a steady, cold,\r\nglassy eye; but he opened the
    door and went in. His master was there\r\nwith another man and he tried to say
    \u2018Good morning, sir,\u2019 in a natural\r\nand calm voice; but he knew that
    the strange man had been engaged\r\ninstead of himself, and this knowledge posted
    itself between his tongue\r\nand his thought. He heard himself stammering, he
    felt that his whole\r\nbearing had become drooping and abject. His master was
    talking swiftly\r\nand the other man was looking at him in an embarrassed, stealthy,
    and\r\npleading manner: his eyes seemed to be apologising for having supplanted\r\nhim--so
    he mumbled \u2018Good day, sir,\u2019 and stumbled out.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen he
    got outside he could not think where to go. After a while he\r\nwent in the direction
    of the little park in the centre of the city. It\r\nwas quite near and he sat
    down on an iron bench facing a pond. There\r\nwere children walking up and down
    by the water giving pieces of bread to\r\nthe swans. Now and again a labouring
    man or a messenger went by quickly;\r\nnow and again a middleaged, slovenly-dressed
    man drooped past aimlessly:\r\nsometimes a tattered, self-intent woman with a
    badgered face flopped by\r\nhim. When he looked at these dull people the thought
    came to him that\r\nthey were not walking there at all; they were trailing through
    hell,\r\nand their desperate eyes saw none but devils around them. He saw himself\r\njoining
    these battered strollers... and he could not think what he would\r\ntell his
    wife when he went home. He rehearsed to himself the terms of\r\nhis dismissal
    a hundred times. How his master looked, what he had said:\r\nand then the fine,
    ironical things he had said to his master. He sat in\r\nthe park all day, and
    when evening fell he went home at his accustomed\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\u201CHis wife
    asked him questions as to how he had got on, and wanted to\r\nknow was there
    any chance of being paid for the weeks of absence; the\r\nman answered her volubly,
    ate his supper and went to bed: but he did\r\nnot tell his wife that he had been
    dismissed and that there would be no\r\nmoney at the end of the week. He tried
    to tell her, but when he met her\r\neye he found that he could not say the words--he
    was afraid of the look\r\nthat might come into her face when she heard it--she,
    standing terrified\r\nin those dismantled rooms...!\r\n\r\n\u201CIn the morning
    he ate his breakfast and went out again--to work, his\r\nwife thought. She bid
    him ask the master about the three weeks\u2019 wages,\r\nor to try and get an
    advance on the present week\u2019s wages, for they were\r\nhardly put to it to
    buy food. He said he would do his best, but he\r\nwent straight to the park and
    sat looking at the pond, looking at the\r\npassers-by and dreaming. In the middle
    of the day he started up in\r\na panic and went about the city asking for work
    in offices, shops,\r\nwarehouses, everywhere, but he could not get any. He trailed
    back\r\nheavy-footed again to the park and sat down.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe told his
    wife more lies about his work that night and what his\r\nmaster had said when
    he asked for an advance. He couldn\u2019t bear the\r\nchildren to touch him.
    After a little time he sneaked away to his bed.\r\n\r\n\u201CA week went that
    way. He didn\u2019t look for work any more. He sat in the\r\npark, dreaming,
    with his head bowed into his hands. The next day would\r\nbe the day he should
    have been paid his wages. The next day! What would\r\nhis wife say when he told
    her he had no money? She would stare at him\r\nand flush and say-\u2019Didn\u2019t
    you go out every day to work?\u2019--How would he\r\ntell her then so that she
    could understand quickly and spare him words?\r\n\r\n\u201CMorning came and the
    man ate his breakfast silently. There was no\r\nbutter on the bread, and his
    wife seemed to be apologising to him for\r\nnot having any. She said, \u2018We\u2019ll
    be able to start fair from to-morrow,\u2019\r\nand when he snapped at her angrily
    she thought it was because he had to\r\neat dry bread.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe went to
    the park and sat there for hours. Now and again he got up\r\nand walked into
    a neighbouring street, but always, after half an hour\r\nor so, he came back.
    Six o\u2019clock in the evening was his hour for going\r\nhome. When six o\u2019clock
    came he did not move, he still sat opposite the\r\npond with his head bowed down
    into his arms. Seven o\u2019clock passed. At\r\nnine o\u2019clock a bell was
    rung and every one had to leave. He went also.\r\nHe stood outside the gates
    looking on this side and on that. Which\r\nway would he go? All roads were alike
    to him, so he turned at last and\r\nwalked somewhere. He did not go home that
    night. He never went home\r\nagain. He never was heard of again anywhere in the
    wide world.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe voice ceased speaking and silence swung down again
    upon the little\r\ncell. The Philosopher had been listening intently to this
    story, and\r\nafter a few minutes he spoke \u201CWhen you go up this road there
    is a turn\r\nto the left and all the path along is bordered with trees--there
    are\r\nbirds in the trees, Glory be to God! There is only one house on that\r\nroad,
    and the woman in it gave us milk to drink. She has but one son, a\r\ngood boy,
    and she said the other children were dead; she was speaking of\r\na husband who
    went away and left her--\u2018Why should he have been afraid to\r\ncome home?\u2019
    said she--\u2018sure, I loved him.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nAfter a little interval
    the voice spoke again \u201CI don\u2019t know what became\r\nof the man I was
    speaking of. I am a thief, and I\u2019m well known to the\r\npolice everywhere.
    I don\u2019t think that man would get a welcome at the\r\nhouse up here, for
    why should he?\u201D\r\n\r\nAnother, a different, querulous kind of voice came
    from the silence \u201CIf\r\nI knew a place where there was a welcome I\u2019d
    go there as quickly as I\r\ncould, but I don\u2019t know a place and I never
    will, for what good would\r\na man of my age be to any person? I am a thief also.
    The first thing I\r\nstole was a hen out of a little yard. I roasted it in a
    ditch and ate\r\nit, and then I stole another one and ate it, and after that
    I stole\r\neverything I could lay my hands on. I suppose I will steal as long
    as I\r\nlive, and I\u2019ll die in a ditch at the heel of the hunt. There was
    a time,\r\nnot long ago, and if any one had told me then that I would rob, even\r\nfor
    hunger, I\u2019d have been insulted: but what does it matter now? And\r\nthe
    reason I am a thief is because I got old without noticing it.\r\nOther people
    noticed it, but I did not. I suppose age comes on one so\r\ngradually that it
    is seldom observed. If there are wrinkles on one\u2019s\r\nface we do not remember
    when they were not there: we put down all kind\r\nof little infirmities to sedentary
    living, and you will see plenty of\r\nyoung people bald. If a man has no occasion
    to tell any one his age,\r\nand if he never thinks of it himself, he won\u2019t
    see ten years\u2019 difference\r\nbetween his youth and his age, for we live
    in slow, quiet times, and\r\nnothing ever happens to mark the years as they go
    by, one after the\r\nother, and all the same.\r\n\r\n\u201CI lodged in a house
    for a great many years, and a little girl grew\r\nup there, the daughter of my
    landlady. She used to slide down the\r\nbannisters very well, and she used to
    play the piano very badly. These\r\ntwo things worried me many a time. She used
    to bring me my meals in the\r\nmorning and the evening, and often enough she\u2019d
    stop to talk with me\r\nwhile I was eating. She was a very chatty girl and I
    was a talkative\r\nperson myself. When she was about eighteen years of age I
    got so used\r\nto her that if her mother came with the food I would be worried
    for\r\nthe rest of the day. Her face was as bright as a sunbeam, and her lazy,\r\ncareless
    ways, big, free movements, and girlish chatter were pleasant to\r\na man whose
    loneliness was only beginning to be apparent to him through\r\nher company. I\u2019ve
    thought of it often since, and I suppose that\u2019s how it\r\nbegan. She used
    to listen to all my opinions and she\u2019d agree with them\r\nbecause she had
    none of her own yet. She was a good girl, but lazy in\r\nher mind and body; childish,
    in fact. Her talk was as involved as her\r\nactions: she always seemed to be
    sliding down mental bannisters; she\r\nthought in kinks and spoke in spasms,
    hopped mentally from one subject\r\nto another without the slightest difficulty,
    and could use a lot of\r\nlanguage in saying nothing at all. I could see all
    that at the time, but\r\nI suppose I was too pleased with my own sharp business
    brains, and\r\nsick enough, although I did not know it, of my sharp-brained,
    business\r\ncompanions--dear Lord! I remember them well. It\u2019s easy enough
    to have\r\nbrains as they call it, but it is not so easy to have a little gaiety\r\nor
    carelessness or childishness or whatever it was she had. It is good,\r\ntoo,
    to feel superior to some one, even a girl.\r\n\r\n\u201COne day this thought
    came to me--\u2018It is time that I settled down.\u2019 I\r\ndon\u2019t know
    where the idea came from; one hears it often enough and it\r\nalways seems to
    apply to some one else, but I don\u2019t know what brought\r\nit to roost with
    me. I was foolish, too: I bought ties and differently\r\nshaped collars, and
    took to creasing my trousers by folding them under\r\nthe bed and lying on them
    all night--It never struck me that I was more\r\nthan three times her age. I
    brought home sweets for her and she was\r\ndelighted. She said she adored sweets,
    and she used to insist on my\r\neating some of them with her; she liked to compare
    notes as to how they\r\ntasted while eating them. I used to get a toothache from
    them, but I\r\nbore with it although at that time I hated toothache almost as
    much as\r\nI hated sweets. Then I asked her to come out with me for a walk. She\r\nwas
    willing enough and it was a novel experience for me. Indeed, it was\r\nrather
    exciting. We went out together often after that, and sometimes\r\nwe\u2019d meet
    people I knew, young men from my office or from other offices.\r\nI used to be
    shy when some of these people winked at me as they saluted.\r\nIt was pleasant,
    too, telling the girl who they were, their business and\r\ntheir salaries: for
    there was little I didn\u2019t know. I used to tell her\r\nof my own position
    in the office and what the chief said to me through\r\nthe day. Sometimes we
    talked of the things that had appeared in the\r\nevening papers. A murder perhaps,
    some phase of a divorce case, the\r\nspeech a political person had made, or the
    price of stock. She was\r\ninterested in anything so long as it was talk. And
    her own share in the\r\nconversation was good to hear. Every lady that passed
    us had a hat that\r\nstirred her to the top of rapture or the other pinnacle
    of disgust.\r\nShe told me what ladies were frights and what were ducks. Under
    her\r\nscampering tongue I began to learn something of humanity, even though\r\nshe
    saw most people as delightfully funny clowns or superb, majestical\r\nprinces,
    but I noticed that she never said a bad word of a man, although\r\nmany of the
    men she looked after were ordinary enough. Until I went\r\nwalking with her I
    never knew what a shop window was. A jeweller\u2019s\r\nwindow especially: there
    were curious things in it. She told me how a\r\ntiara should be worn, and a pendant,
    and she explained the kind of studs\r\nI should wear myself; they were made of
    gold and had red stones in them;\r\nshe showed me the ropes of pearl or diamonds
    that she thought would look\r\npretty on herself: and one day she said that she
    liked me very much. I\r\nwas pleased and excited that day, but I was a business
    man and I said\r\nvery little in reply. I never liked a pig in a poke.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe
    used to go out two nights in the week, Monday and Thursday, dressed\r\nin her
    best clothes. I didn\u2019t know where she went, and I didn\u2019t ask--I\r\nthought
    she visited an acquaintance, a girl friend or some such. The\r\ntime went by
    and I made up my mind to ask her to marry me. I had watched\r\nher long enough
    and she was always kind and bright. I liked the way she\r\nsmiled, and I liked
    her obedient, mannerly bearing. There was something\r\nelse I liked, which I
    did not recognise then, something surrounding all\r\nher movements, a graciousness,
    a spaciousness: I did not analyse it;\r\nbut I know now that it was her youth.
    I remember that when we were out\r\ntogether she walked slowly, but in the house
    she would leap up and down\r\nthe stairs--she moved furiously, but I didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201COne
    evening she dressed to go out as usual, and she called at my door\r\nto know
    had I everything I wanted. I said I had something to tell her\r\nwhen she came
    home, something important. She promised to come in early\r\nto hear it, and I
    laughed at her and she laughed back and went sliding\r\ndown the bannisters.
    I don\u2019t think I have had any reason to laugh since\r\nthat night. A letter
    came for me after she had gone, and I knew by the\r\nshape and the handwriting
    that it was from the office. It puzzled me to\r\nthink why I should be written
    to. I didn\u2019t like opening it somehow....\r\nIt was my dismissal on account
    of advancing age, and it hoped for my\r\nfuture welfare politely enough. It was
    signed by the Senior. I didn\u2019t\r\ngrip it at first, and then I thought it
    was a hoax. For a long time I\r\nsat in my room with an empty mind. I was watching
    my mind: there were\r\nimmense distances in it that drowsed and buzzed; large,
    soft movements\r\nseemed to be made in my mind, and although I was looking at
    the letter\r\nin my hand I was really trying to focus those great, swinging spaces
    in\r\nmy brain, and my ears were listening for a movement of some kind. I\r\ncan
    see back to that time plainly. I went walking up and down the room.\r\nThere
    was a dull, subterranean anger in me. I remember muttering once or\r\ntwice,
    \u2018Shameful!\u2019 and again I said, \u2018Ridiculous!\u2019 At the idea of
    age\r\nI looked at my face in the glass, but I was looking at my mind, and\r\nit
    seemed to go grey, there was a heaviness there also. I seemed to be\r\npeering
    from beneath a weight at something strange. I had a feeling that\r\nI had let
    go a grip which I had held tightly for a long time, and I had\r\na feeling that
    the letting go was a grave disaster... that strange face\r\nin the glass! how
    wrinkled it was! there were only a few hairs on the\r\nhead and they were grey
    ones. There was a constant twitching of the lips\r\nand the eyes were deep-set,
    little and dull. I left the glass and sat\r\ndown by the window, looking out.
    I saw nothing in the street: I just\r\nlooked into a blackness. My mind was as
    blank as the night and as\r\nsoundless. There was a swirl outside the window,
    rain tossed by the\r\nwind; without noticing, I saw it, and my brain swung with
    the rain until\r\nit heaved in circles, and then a feeling of faintness awakened
    me to\r\nmyself. I did not allow my mind to think, but now and again a word\r\nswooped
    from immense distances through my brain, swinging like a comet\r\nacross a sky
    and jarring terribly when it struck: \u2018Sacked\u2019 was one word,\r\n\u2018Old\u2019
    was another word.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know how long I sat watching the
    flight of these dreadful words\r\nand listening to their clanking impact, but
    a movement in the street\r\naroused me. Two people, the girl and a young, slender
    man, were coming\r\nslowly up to the house. The rain was falling heavily, but
    they did not\r\nseem to mind it. There was a big puddle of water close to the
    kerb, and\r\nthe girl, stepping daintily as a cat, went round this, but the young
    man\r\nstood for a moment beyond it. He raised both arms, clenched his fists,\r\nswung
    them, and jumped over the puddle. Then he and the girl stood\r\nlooking at the
    water, apparently measuring the jump. I could see them\r\nplainly by a street
    lamp. They were bidding each other good-bye. The\r\ngirl put her hand to his
    neck and settled the collar of his coat, and\r\nwhile her hand rested on him
    the young man suddenly and violently flung\r\nhis arms about her and hugged her;
    then they kissed and moved apart. The\r\nman walked to the rain puddle and stood
    there with his face turned back\r\nlaughing at her, and then he jumped straight
    into the middle of the\r\npuddle and began to dance up and down in it, the muddy
    water splashing\r\nup to his knees. She ran over to him crying \u2018Stop, silly!\u2019
    When she came\r\ninto the house, I bolted my door and I gave no answer to her
    knock.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn a few months the money I had saved was spent. I couldn\u2019t
    get any\r\nwork, I was too old; they put it that they wanted a younger man. I\r\ncouldn\u2019t
    pay my rent. I went out into the world again, like a baby,\r\nan old baby in
    a new world. I stole food, food, food anywhere and\r\neverywhere. At first I
    was always caught. Often I was sent to gaol;\r\nsometimes I was let go; sometimes
    I was kicked; but I learned to live\r\nlike a wolf at last. I am not often caught
    now when I steal food. But\r\nthere is something happening every day, whether
    it is going to gaol or\r\nplanning how to steal a hen or a loaf of bread. I find
    that it is a good\r\nlife, much better than the one I lived for nearly sixty
    years, and I\r\nhave time to think over every sort of thing....\u201D\r\n\r\nWhen
    the morning came the Philosopher was taken on a car to the big\r\nCity in order
    that he might be put on his trial and hanged. It was the\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK
    VI. THE THIN WOMAN\u2019S JOURNEY AND THE HAPPY MARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XVII\r\n\r\nTHE ability of the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath for anger was unbounded.\r\nShe
    was not one of those limited creatures who are swept clean by a gust\r\nof wrath
    and left placid and smiling after its passing. She could store\r\nher anger in
    those caverns of eternity which open into every soul, and\r\nwhich are filled
    with rage and violence until the time comes when they\r\nmay be stored with wisdom
    and love; for, in the genesis of life, love\r\nis at the beginning and the end
    of things. First, like a laughing\r\nchild, love came to labour minutely in the
    rocks and sands of the heart,\r\nopening the first of those roads which lead
    inwards for ever, and then,\r\nthe labour of his day being done, love fled away
    and was forgotten.\r\nFollowing came the fierce winds of hate to work like giants
    and gnomes\r\namong the prodigious debris, quarrying the rocks and levelling
    the\r\nroads which soar inwards; but when that work is completed love will come\r\nradiantly
    again to live for ever in the human heart, which is Eternity.\r\n\r\nBefore the
    Thin Woman could undertake the redemption of her husband by\r\nwrath, it was
    necessary that she should be purified by the performance\r\nof that sacrifice
    which is called the Forgiveness of Enemies, and this\r\nshe did by embracing
    the Leprecauns of the Gort and in the presence of\r\nthe sun and the wind remitting
    their crime against her husband. Thus she\r\nbecame free to devote her malice
    against the State of Punishment, while\r\nforgiving the individuals who had but
    acted in obedience to the pressure\r\nof their infernal environment, which pressure
    is Sin.\r\n\r\nThis done she set about baking the three cakes against her journey
    to\r\nAngus Og.\r\n\r\nWhile she was baking the cakes, the children, Seumas and
    Brigid Beg,\r\nslipped away into the wood to speak to each other and to wonder
    over\r\nthis extraordinary occurrence.\r\n\r\nAt first their movements were very
    careful, for they could not be quite\r\nsure that the policemen had really gone
    away, or whether they were\r\nhiding in dark places waiting to pounce on them
    and carry them away\r\nto captivity. The word \u201Cmurder\u201D was almost unknown
    to them, and its\r\nstrangeness was rendered still more strange by reason of
    the nearness\r\nof their father to the term. It was a terrible word and its terror
    was\r\nmagnified by their father\u2019s unthinkable implication. What had he
    done?\r\nAlmost all his actions and habits were so familiar to them as to be\r\ncommonplace,
    and yet, there was a dark something to which he was a\r\nparty and which dashed
    before them as terrible and ungraspable as a\r\nlightning-flash. They understood
    that it had something to do with that\r\nother father and mother whose bodies
    had been snatched from beneath\r\nthe hearthstone, but they knew the Philosopher
    had done nothing in that\r\ninstance, and, so, they saw murder as a terrible,
    occult affair which\r\nwas quite beyond their mental horizons.\r\n\r\nNo one
    jumped out on them from behind the trees, so in a little time\r\ntheir confidence
    returned and they walked less carefully. When they\r\nreached the edge of the
    pine wood the brilliant sunshine invited them to\r\ngo farther, and after a little
    hesitation they did so. The good spaces\r\nand the sweet air dissipated their
    melancholy thoughts, and very soon\r\nthey were racing each other to this point
    and to that. Their wayward\r\nflights had carried them in the direction of Meehawl
    MacMurrachu\u2019s\r\ncottage, and here, breathlessly, they threw themselves
    under a small\r\ntree to rest. It was a thorn bush, and as they sat beneath it
    the\r\ncessation of movement gave them opportunity to again consider the\r\nterrible
    position of their father. With children thought cannot be\r\nseparated from action
    for very long. They think as much with their hands\r\nas with their heads. They
    have to do the thing they speak of in order\r\nto visualise the idea, and, consequently,
    Seumas Beg was soon\r\nreconstructing the earlier visit of the policemen to their
    house\r\nin grand pantomime. The ground beneath the thorn bush became the\r\nhearthstone
    of their cottage; he and Brigid became four policemen, and\r\nin a moment he
    was digging furiously with a broad piece of wood to find\r\nthe two hidden bodies.
    He had digged for only a few minutes when the\r\npiece of wood struck against
    something hard. A very little time sufficed\r\nto throw the soil off this, and
    their delight was great when they\r\nunearthed a beautiful little earthen crock
    filled to the brim with\r\nshining, yellow dust. When they lifted this they were
    astonished at its\r\ngreat weight. They played for a long time with it, letting
    the heavy,\r\nyellow shower slip through their fingers and watching it glisten
    in the\r\nsunshine. After they tired of this they decided to bring the crock
    home,\r\nbut by the time they reached the Gort na Cloca Mora they were so tired\r\nthat
    they could not carry it any farther, and they decided to leave it\r\nwith their
    friends the Leprecauns. Seumas Beg gave the taps on the tree\r\ntrunk which they
    had learned, and in a moment the Leprecaun whom they\r\nknew came up.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    have brought this, sir,\u201D said Seumas. But he got no further, for the\r\ninstant
    the Leprecaun saw the crock he threw his arms around it and wept\r\nin so loud
    a voice that his comrades swarmed up to see what had happened\r\nto him, and
    they added their laughter and tears to his, to which chorus\r\nthe children subjoined
    their sympathetic clamour, so that a noise of\r\ngreat complexity rang through
    all the Gort.\r\n\r\nBut the Leprecauns\u2019 surrender to this happy passion
    was short. Hard on\r\ntheir gladness came remembrance and consternation; and
    then repentance,\r\nthat dismal virtue, wailed in their ears and their hearts.
    How could\r\nthey thank the children whose father and protector they had delivered\r\nto
    the unilluminated justice of humanity? that justice which demands not\r\natonement
    but punishment; which is learned in the Book of Enmity but\r\nnot in the Book
    of Friendship; which calls hatred Nature, and Love a\r\nconspiracy; whose law
    is an iron chain and whose mercy is debility\r\nand chagrin; the blind fiend
    who would impose his own blindness; that\r\nunfruitful loin which curses fertility;
    that stony heart which would\r\npetrify the generations of man; before whom life
    withers away appalled\r\nand death would shudder again to its tomb. Repentance!
    they wiped the\r\ninadequate ooze from their eyes and danced joyfully for spite.
    They\r\ncould do no more, so they fed the children lovingly and carried them\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe
    Thin Woman had baked three cakes. One of these she gave to each of\r\nthe children
    and one she kept herself, whereupon they set out upon their\r\njourney to Angus
    Og.\r\n\r\nIt was well after midday when they started. The fresh gaiety of\r\nthe
    morning was gone, and a tyrannous sun, whose majesty was almost\r\ninsupportable,
    forded it over the world. There was but little shade\r\nfor the travellers, and,
    after a time, they became hot and weary and\r\nthirsty--that is, the children
    did, but the Thin Woman, by reason of her\r\nthinness, was proof against every
    elemental rigour, except hunger, from\r\nwhich no creature is free.\r\n\r\nShe
    strode in the centre of the road, a very volcano of silence,\r\nthinking twenty
    different thoughts at the one moment, so that the\r\nurgency of her desire for
    utterance kept her terribly quiet; but against\r\nthis crust of quietude there
    was accumulating a mass of speech which\r\nmust at the last explode or petrify.
    From this congestion of thought\r\nthere arose the first deep rumblings, precursors
    of uproar, and another\r\nmoment would have heard the thunder of her varied malediction,
    but that\r\nBrigid Beg began to cry: for, indeed, the poor child was both tired\r\nand
    parched to distraction, and Seumas had no barrier against a similar\r\nsurrender,
    but two minutes\u2019 worth of boyish pride. This discovery\r\nwithdrew the Thin
    Woman from her fiery contemplations, and in comforting\r\nthe children she forgot
    her own hardships.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary to find water quickly: no difficult
    thing, for the\r\nThin Woman, being a Natural, was like all other creatures able
    to sense\r\nthe whereabouts of water, and so she at once led the children in
    a\r\nslightly different direction. In a few minutes they reached a well by\r\nthe
    road-side, and here the children drank deeply and were comforted.\r\nThere was
    a wide, leafy tree growing hard by the well, and in the shade\r\nof this tree
    they sat down and ate their cakes.\r\n\r\nWhile they rested the Thin Woman advised
    the children on many important\r\nmatters. She never addressed her discourse
    to both of them at once,\r\nbut spoke first to Seumas on one subject and then
    to Brigid on another\r\nsubject; for, as she said, the things which a boy must
    learn are not\r\nthose which are necessary to a girl. It is particularly important
    that a\r\nman should understand how to circumvent women, for this and the capture\r\nof
    food forms the basis of masculine wisdom, and on this subject she\r\nspoke to
    Seumas. It is, however, equally urgent that a woman should be\r\nskilled to keep
    a man in his proper place, and to this thesis Brigid\r\ngave an undivided attention.\r\n\r\nShe
    taught that a man must hate all women before he is able to love a\r\nwoman, but
    that he is at liberty, or rather he is under express command,\r\nto love all
    men because they are of his kind. Women also should love\r\nall other women as
    themselves, and they should hate all men but one man\r\nonly, and him they should
    seek to turn into a woman, because women, by\r\nthe order of their beings, must
    be either tyrants or slaves, and it is\r\nbetter they should be tyrants than
    slaves. She explained that between\r\nmen and women there exists a state of unremitting
    warfare, and that\r\nthe endeavour of each sex is to bring the other to subjection;
    but that\r\nwomen are possessed by a demon called Pity which severely handicaps\r\ntheir
    battle and perpetually gives victory to the male, who is thus\r\nconstantly rescued
    on the very ridges of defeat. She said to Seumas\r\nthat his fatal day would
    dawn when he loved a woman, because he would\r\nsacrifice his destiny to her
    caprice, and she begged him for love of her\r\nto beware of all that twisty sex.
    To Brigid she revealed that a woman\u2019s\r\nterrible day is upon her when she
    knows that a man loves her, for a man\r\nin love submits only to a woman, a partial,
    individual and temporary\r\nsubmission, but a woman who is loved surrenders more
    fully to the\r\nvery god of love himself, and so she becomes a slave, and is
    not alone\r\ndeprived of her personal liberty, but is even infected in her mental\r\nprocesses
    by this crafty obsession. The fates work for man, and\r\ntherefore, she averred,
    woman must be victorious, for those who dare to\r\nwar against the gods are already
    assured of victory: this being the\r\nlaw of life, that only the weak shall conquer.
    The limit of strength\r\nis petrifaction and immobility, but there is no limit
    to weakness, and\r\ncunning or fluidity is its counsellor. For these reasons,
    and in order\r\nthat life might not cease, women should seek to turn their husbands
    into\r\nwomen; then they would be tyrants and their husbands would be slaves,\r\nand
    life would be renewed for a further period.\r\n\r\nAs the Thin Woman proceeded
    with this lesson it became at last so\r\nextremely complicated that she was brought
    to a stand by the knots, so\r\nshe decided to resume their journey and disentangle
    her argument when\r\nthe weather became cooler.\r\n\r\nThey were repacking the
    cakes in their wallets when they observed a\r\nstout, comely female coming towards
    the well. This woman, when she drew\r\nnear, saluted the Thin Woman, and her
    the Thin Woman saluted again,\r\nwhereupon the stranger sat down.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s
    hot weather, surely,\u201D said she, \u201Cand I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s as
    much as\r\na body\u2019s life is worth to be travelling this day and the sun
    the way it\r\nis. Did you come far, now, ma\u2019am, or is it that you are used
    to going\r\nthe roads and don\u2019t mind it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot far,\u201D
    said the Thin Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CFar or near,\u201D said the stranger, \u201Ca
    perch is as much as I\u2019d like to\r\ntravel this time of the year. That\u2019s
    a fine pair of children you have\r\nwith you now, ma\u2019am.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey
    are,\u201D said the Thin Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve ten of them myself,\u201D
    the other continued, \u201Cand I often wondered\r\nwhere they came from. It\u2019s
    queer to think of one woman making ten new\r\ncreatures and she not getting a
    penny for it, nor any thanks itself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is,\u201D said the
    Thin Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you ever talk more than two words at the one time,
    ma\u2019am?\u201D said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D said the Thin
    Woman.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d give a penny to hear you,\u201D replied the other
    angrily, \u201Cfor a more\r\nbad-natured, cross-grained, cantankerous person
    than yourself I never\r\nmet among womankind. It\u2019s what I said to a man
    only yesterday, that thin\r\nones are bad ones, and there isn\u2019t any one
    could be thinner than you are\r\nyourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe reason you
    say that,\u201D said the Thin Woman calmly, \u201Cis because you\r\nare fat and
    you have to tell lies to yourself to hide your misfortune,\r\nand let on that
    you like it. There is no one in the world could like to\r\nbe fat, and there
    I leave you, ma\u2019am. You can poke your finger in\r\nyour own eye, but you
    may keep it out of mine if you please, and, so,\r\ngood-bye to you; and if I
    wasn\u2019t a quiet woman I\u2019d pull you by the hair\r\nof the head up a hill
    and down a hill for two hours, and now there\u2019s an\r\nend of it. I\u2019ve
    given you more than two words; let you take care or I\u2019ll\r\ngive you two
    more that will put blisters on your body for ever. Come\r\nalong with me now,
    children, and if ever you see a woman like that woman\r\nyou\u2019ll know that
    she eats until she can\u2019t stand, and drinks until she\r\ncan\u2019t sit,
    and sleeps until she is stupid; and if that sort of person\r\never talks to you
    remember that two words are all that\u2019s due to her, and\r\nlet them be short
    ones, for a woman like that would be a traitor and a\r\nthief, only that she\u2019s
    too lazy to be anything but a sot, God help her I\r\nand, so, good-bye.\u201D\r\n\r\nThereupon
    the Thin Woman and the children arose, and having saluted the\r\nstranger they
    went down the wide path; but the other woman stayed where\r\nshe was sitting,
    and she did not say a word even to herself.\r\n\r\nAs she strode along the Thin
    Woman lapsed again to her anger, and became\r\nso distant in her aspect that
    the children could get no companionship\r\nfrom her; so, after a while, they
    ceased to consider her at all and\r\naddressed themselves to their play. They
    danced before and behind\r\nand around her. They ran and doubled, shouted and
    laughed and sang.\r\nSometimes they pretended they were husband and wife, and
    then they\r\nplodded quietly side by side, making wise, occasional remarks on
    the\r\nweather, or the condition of their health, or the state of the fields
    of\r\nrye. Sometimes one was a horse and the other was a driver, and then\r\nthey
    stamped along the road with loud, fierce snortings and louder and\r\nfiercer
    commands. At another moment one was a cow being driven with\r\ngreat difficulty
    to market by a driver whose temper had given way hours\r\nbefore; or they both
    became goats and with their heads jammed together\r\nthey pushed and squealed
    viciously; and these changes lapsed into one\r\nanother so easily that at no
    moment were they unoccupied. But as the\r\nday wore on to evening the immense
    surrounding quietude began to weigh\r\nheavily upon them. Saving for their own
    shrill voices there was no\r\nsound, and this unending, wide silence at last
    commanded them to a\r\ncorresponding quietness. Little by little they ceased
    their play. The\r\nscamper became a trot, each run was more and more curtailed
    in its\r\nlength, the race back became swifter than the run forth, and, shortly,\r\nthey
    were pacing soberly enough one on either side of the Thin Woman\r\nsending back
    and forth a few quiet sentences. Soon even these sentences\r\ntrailed away into
    the vast surrounding stillness. Then Brigid Beg\r\nclutched the Thin Woman\u2019s
    right hand, and not long after Seumas gently\r\nclasped her left hand, and these
    mute appeals for protection and comfort\r\nagain released her from the valleys
    of fury through which she had been\r\nso fiercely careering.\r\n\r\nAs they went
    gently along they saw a cow lying in a field, and, seeing\r\nthis animal, the
    Thin Woman stopped thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\u201CEverything,\u201D said she, \u201Cbelongs
    to the wayfarer,\u201D and she crossed into\r\nthe field and milked the cow into
    a vessel which she had.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wonder,\u201D said Seumas, \u201Cwho owns
    that cow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe,\u201D said Brigid Beg, \u201Cnobody owns
    her at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe cow owns herself,\u201D said the Thin Woman,
    \u201Cfor nobody can own a thing\r\nthat is alive. I am sure she gives her milk
    to us with great goodwill,\r\nfor we are modest, temperate people without greed
    or pretension.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn being released the cow lay down again in the grass
    and resumed its\r\ninterrupted cud. As the evening had grown chill the Thin Woman
    and the\r\nchildren huddled close to the warm animal. They drew pieces of cake
    from\r\ntheir wallets, and ate these and drank happily from the vessel of milk.\r\nNow
    and then the cow looked benignantly over its shoulder bidding them\r\na welcome
    to its hospitable flanks. It had a mild, motherly eye, and\r\nit was very fond
    of children. The youngsters continually deserted their\r\nmeal in order to put
    their arms about the cow\u2019s neck to thank and praise\r\nher for her goodness,
    and to draw each other\u2019s attention to various\r\nexcellences in its appearance.\r\n\r\n\u201CCow,\u201D
    said Brigid Beg in an ecstasy, \u201CI love you.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo do I,\u201D
    said Seumas. \u201CDo you notice the kind of eyes it has?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy
    does a cow have horns?\u201D said Brigid.\r\n\r\nSo they asked the cow that question,
    but it only smiled and said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf a cow talked to you,\u201D
    said Brigid, \u201Cwhat would it say?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLet us be cows,\u201D
    replied Seumas, \u201Cand then, maybe, we will find out.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they
    became cows and ate a few blades of grass, but they found that\r\nwhen they were
    cows they did not want to say anything but \u201Cmoo,\u201D and\r\nthey decided
    that cows did not want to say anything more than that\r\neither, and they became
    interested in the reflection that, perhaps,\r\nnothing else was worth saying.\r\n\r\nA
    long, thin, yellow-coloured fly was going in that direction on a\r\njourney,
    and he stopped to rest himself on the cow\u2019s nose.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are welcome,\u201D
    said the cow.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a great night for travelling,\u201D said
    the fly, \u201Cbut one gets tired\r\nalone. Have you seen any of my people about?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D
    replied the cow, \u201Cno one but beetles to-night, and they seldom\r\nstop for
    a talk. You\u2019ve rather a good kind of life, I suppose, flying\r\nabout and
    enjoying yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe all have our troubles,\u201D said the
    fly in a melancholy voice, and he\r\ncommenced to clean his right wing with his
    leg.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoes any one ever lie against your back the way these people
    are lying\r\nagainst mine, or do they steal your milk?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    are too many spiders about,\u201D said the fly.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo corner is safe
    from them; they squat in the grass and pounce on you.\r\nI\u2019ve got a twist,
    my eye trying to watch them. They are ugly,\r\nvoracious people without manners
    or neighbourliness, terrible, terrible\r\ncreatures.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have
    seen them,\u201D said the cow, \u201Cbut they never done me any harm. Move\r\nup
    a little bit please, I want to lick my nose: it\u2019s queer how itchy my\r\nnose
    gets\u201D--the fly moved up a bit. \u201CIf,\u201D the cow continued, \u201Cyou
    had\r\nstayed there, and if my tongue had hit you, I don\u2019t suppose you would\r\never
    have recovered.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour tongue couldn\u2019t have hit me,\u201D
    said the by. \u201CI move very quickly\r\nyou know.\u201D\r\n\r\nHereupon the
    cow slily whacked her tongue across her nose. She did not\r\nsee the fly move,
    but it was hovering safely half an inch over her nose.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see,\u201D
    said the fly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D replied the cow, and she bellowed so sudden
    and furious a snort\r\nof laughter that the fly was blown far away by that gust
    and never came\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nThis amused the cow exceedingly, and she
    chuckled and sniggered to\r\nherself for a long time. The children had listened
    with great interest\r\nto the conversation, and they also laughed delightedly,
    and the Thin\r\nWoman admitted that the fly had got the worse of it; but, after
    a while,\r\nshe said that the part of the cow\u2019s back against which she was
    resting\r\nwas bonier than anything she had ever leaned upon before, and that
    while\r\nthinness was a virtue no one had any right to be thin in lumps, and
    that\r\non this count the cow was not to be commended. On hearing this the cow\r\narose,
    and without another look at them it walked away into the dusky\r\nfield. The
    Thin Woman told the children afterwards that she was sorry\r\nshe had said anything,
    but she was unable to bring her self to apologise\r\nto the cow, and so they
    were forced to resume their journey in order to\r\nkeep themselves warm.\r\n\r\nThere
    was a sickle moon in the sky, a tender sword whose radiance stayed\r\nin its
    own high places and did not at all illumine the heavy world\r\nbelow; the glimmer
    of infrequent stars could also be seen with spacious,\r\ndark solitudes between
    them; but on the earth the darkness gathered\r\nin fold on fold of misty veiling,
    through which the trees uttered an\r\nearnest whisper, and the grasses lifted
    their little voices, and the\r\nwind crooned its thrilling, stern lament.\r\n\r\nAs
    the travellers walked on, their eyes, flinching from the darkness,\r\nrested
    joyfully on the gracious moon, but that joy lasted only for a\r\nlittle time.
    The Thin Woman spoke to them curiously about the moon,\r\nand, indeed, she might
    speak with assurance on that subject, for\r\nher ancestors had sported in the
    cold beam through countless dim\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is not known,\u201D
    said she, \u201Cthat the fairies seldom dance for joy,\r\nbut for sadness that
    they have been expelled from the sweet dawn, and\r\ntherefore their midnight
    revels are only ceremonies to remind them\r\nof their happy state in the morning
    of the world before thoughtful\r\ncuriosity and self-righteous moralities drove
    them from the kind face of\r\nthe sun to the dark exile of midnight. It is strange
    that we may not be\r\nangry while looking on the moon. Indeed, no mere appetite
    or passion of\r\nany kind dare become imperative in the presence of the Shining
    One; and\r\nthis, in a more limited degree, is true also of every form of beauty;\r\nfor
    there is something in an absolute beauty to chide away the desires\r\nof materiality
    and yet to dissolve the spirit in ecstasies of fear and\r\nsadness. Beauty has
    no liking for Thought, but will send terror and\r\nsorrow on those who look upon
    her with intelligent eyes. We may neither\r\nbe angry nor gay in the presence
    of the moon, nor may we dare to think\r\nin her bailiwick, or the Jealous One
    will surely afflict us. I think\r\nthat she is not benevolent but malign, and
    that her mildness is a cloak\r\nfor many shy infamies. I think that beauty tends
    to become frightful as\r\nit becomes perfect, and that, if we could see it comprehendingly,
    the\r\nextreme of beauty is a desolating hideousness, and that the name\r\nof
    ultimate, absolute beauty is Madness. Therefore men should seek\r\nloveliness
    rather than beauty, and so they would always have a friend\r\nto go beside them,
    to understand and to comfort them, for that is the\r\nbusiness of loveliness:
    but the business of beauty--there is no person\r\nat all knows what that is.
    Beauty is the extreme which has not yet swung\r\nto and become merged in its
    opposite. The poets have sung of this beauty\r\nand the philosophers have prophesied
    of it, thinking that the beauty\r\nwhich passes all understanding is also the
    peace which passeth\r\nunderstanding; but I think that whatever passes understanding,
    which\r\nis imagination, is terrible, standing aloof from humanity and from\r\nkindness,
    and that this is the sin against the Holy Ghost, the great\r\nArtist. An isolated
    perfection is a symbol of terror and pride, and\r\nit is followed only by the
    head of man, but the heart winces from it\r\naghast, cleaving to that loveliness
    which is modesty and righteousness.\r\nEvery extreme is bad, in order that it
    may swing to and fertilize its\r\nequally horrible opposite.\u201D\r\n\r\nThus,
    speaking more to herself than to the children, the Thin Woman\r\nbeguiled the
    way. The moon had brightened as she spoke, and on either\r\nside of the path,
    wherever there was a tree or a rise in the ground,\r\na black shadow was crouching
    tensely watchful, seeming as if it might\r\nspring into terrible life at a bound.
    Of these shadows the children\r\nbecame so fearful that the Thin Woman forsook
    the path and adventured on\r\nthe open hillside, so that in a short time the
    road was left behind and\r\naround them stretched the quiet slopes in the full
    shining of the moon.\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked for a long time the children
    became sleepy; they\r\nwere unused to being awake in the night, and as there
    was no place where\r\nthey could rest, and as it was evident that they could
    not walk much\r\nfurther, the Thin Woman grew anxious. Already Brigid had made
    a\r\ntiny, whimpering sound, and Seumas had followed this with a sigh, the\r\nslightest
    prolongation of which might have trailed into a sob, and when\r\nchildren are
    overtaken by tears they do not understand how to escape\r\nfrom them until they
    are simply bored by much weeping.\r\n\r\nWhen they topped a slight incline they
    saw a light shining some distance\r\naway, and toward this the Thin Woman hurried.
    As they drew near she saw\r\nit was a small fire, and around this some figures
    were seated. In a few\r\nminutes she came into the circle of the firelight, and
    here she halted\r\nsuddenly. She would have turned and fled, but fear loosened
    her knees\r\nso that they would not obey her will; also the people by the fire
    had\r\nobserved her, and a great voice commanded that she should draw near.\r\n\r\nThe
    fire was made of branches of heather, and beside it three figures\r\nsat. The
    Thin Woman, hiding her perturbation as well as she could, came\r\nnigh and sat
    down by the fire. After a low word of greeting she gave\r\nsome of her cake to
    the children, drew them close to her, wrapped her\r\nshawl about their heads
    and bade them sleep. Then, shrinkingly, she\r\nlooked at her hosts.\r\n\r\nThey
    were quite naked, and each of them gazed on her with intent\r\nearnestness. The
    first was so beautiful that the eye failed upon him,\r\nflinching aside as from
    a great brightness. He was of mighty stature,\r\nand yet so nobly proportioned,
    so exquisitely slender and graceful, that\r\nno idea of gravity or bulk went
    with his height. His face was kingly\r\nand youthful and of a terrifying serenity.
    The second man was of equal\r\nheight, but broad to wonderment. So broad was
    he that his great height\r\nseemed diminished. The tense arm on which he leaned
    was knotted and\r\nridged with muscle, and his hand gripped deeply into the ground.
    His\r\nface seemed as though it had been hammered from hard rock, a massive,\r\nblunt
    face as rigid as his arm. The third man can scarcely be described.\r\nHe was
    neither short nor tall. He was muscled as heavily as the second\r\nman. As he
    sat he looked like a colossal toad squatting with his arms\r\nabout his knees,
    and upon these his chin rested. He had no shape nor\r\nswiftness, and his head
    was flattened down and was scarcely wider than\r\nhis neck. He had a protruding
    dog-like mouth that twitched occasionally,\r\nand from his little eyes there
    glinted a horrible intelligence. Before\r\nthis man the soul of the Thin Woman
    grovelled. She felt herself crawling\r\nto him. The last terrible abasement of
    which humanity is capable came\r\nupon her: a fascination which would have drawn
    her to him in screaming\r\nadoration. Hardly could she look away from him, but
    her arms were about\r\nthe children, and love, mightiest of the powers, stirred
    fiercely in her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe first man spoke to her.\r\n\r\n\u201CWoman,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cfor what purpose do you go abroad on this night and\r\non this
    hill?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI travel, sir,\u201D said the Thin Woman, \u201Csearching
    for the Brugh of Angus\r\nthe son of the Dagda Mor.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are
    all children of the Great Father,\u201D said he. \u201CDo you know who we\r\nare?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    do not know that,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are the Three Absolutes, the
    Three Redeemers, the three\r\nAlembics--the Most Beautiful Man, the Strongest
    Man and the Ugliest Man.\r\nIn the midst of every strife we go unhurt. We count
    the slain and the\r\nvictors and pass on laughing, and to us in the eternal order
    come all\r\nthe peoples of the world to be regenerated for ever. Why have you
    called\r\nto us?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI did not call to you, indeed,\u201D said
    the Thin Woman; \u201Cbut why do you\r\nsit in the path so that travellers to
    the House of the Dagda are halted\r\non their journey?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    are no paths closed to us,\u201D he replied; \u201Ceven the gods seek us,\r\nfor
    they grow weary in their splendid desolation--saving Him who liveth\r\nin all
    things and in us; Him we serve and before His awful front we\r\nabase ourselves.
    You, O Woman, who are walking in the valleys of anger,\r\nhave called to us in
    your heart, therefore we are waiting for you on the\r\nside of the hill. Choose
    now one of us to be your mate, and do not fear\r\nto choose, for our kingdoms
    are equal and our powers are equal.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy would I choose one
    of you,\u201D replied the Thin Woman, \u201Cwhen I am well\r\nmarried already
    to the best man in the world?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBeyond us there is no best man,\u201D
    said he, \u201Cfor we are the best in\r\nbeauty, and the best in strength, and
    the best in ugliness; there is no\r\nexcellence which is not contained in us
    three. If you are married what\r\ndoes that matter to us who are free from the
    pettiness of jealousy\r\nand fear, being at one with ourselves and with every
    manifestation of\r\nnature.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf,\u201D she replied, \u201Cyou
    are the Absolute and are above all pettiness,\r\ncan you not be superior to me
    also and let me pass quietly on my road to\r\nthe Dagda!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    are what all humanity desire,\u201D quoth he, \u201Cand we desire all\r\nhumanity.
    There is nothing, small or great, disdained by our immortal\r\nappetites. It
    is not lawful, even for the Absolute, to outgrow Desire,\r\nwhich is the breath
    of God quick in his creatures and not to be bounded\r\nor surmounted by any perfection.\u201D\r\n\r\nDuring
    this conversation the other great figures had leaned forward\r\nlistening intently
    but saying nothing. The Thin Woman could feel the\r\nchildren like little, terrified
    birds pressing closely and very quietly\r\nto her sides.\r\n\r\n\u201CSir,\u201D
    said she, \u201Ctell me what is Beauty and what is Strength and what\r\nis Ugliness?
    for, although I can see these things, I do not know what\r\nthey are.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    will tell you that,\u201D he replied--\u201CBeauty is Thought and Strength is\r\nLove
    and Ugliness is Generation. The home of Beauty is the head of man.\r\nThe home
    of Strength is the heart of man, and in the loins Ugliness\r\nkeeps his dreadful
    state. If you come with me you shall know all\r\ndelight. You shall live unharmed
    in the flame of the spirit, and nothing\r\nthat is gross shall bind your limbs
    or hinder your thought. You shall\r\nmove as a queen amongst all raging passions
    without torment or despair.\r\nNever shall you be driven or ashamed, but always
    you will choose your\r\nown paths and walk with me in freedom and contentment
    and beauty.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll things,\u201D said the Thin Woman, \u201Cmust
    act according to the order of\r\ntheir being, and so I say to Thought, if you
    hold me against my will\r\npresently I will bind you against your will, for the
    holder of an\r\nunwilling mate becomes the guardian and the slave of his captive.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat
    is true,\u201D said he, \u201Cand against a thing that is true I cannot\r\ncontend;
    therefore, you are free from me, but from my brethren you are\r\nnot free.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    Thin Woman turned to the second man.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are Strength?\u201D said
    she.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am Strength and Love,\u201D he boomed, \u201Cand with me
    there is safety and\r\npeace; my days have honour and my nights quietness. There
    is no evil\r\nthing walks near my lands, nor is any sound heard but the lowing
    of my\r\ncattle, the songs of my birds and the laughter of my happy children.\r\nCome
    then to me who gives protection and happiness and peace, and does\r\nnot fail
    or grow weary at any time.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI will not go with you,\u201D said
    the Thin Woman, \u201Cfor I am a mother and my\r\nstrength cannot be increased;
    I am a mother and my love cannot be added\r\nto. What have I further to desire
    from thee, thou great man?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are free of me,\u201D said
    the second man, \u201Cbut from my brother you are\r\nnot free.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen
    to the third man the Thin Woman addressed herself in terror, for to\r\nthat hideous
    one something cringed within her in an ecstasy of loathing.\r\nThat repulsion
    which at its strongest becomes attraction gripped her.\r\nA shiver, a plunge,
    and she had gone, but the hands of the children\r\nwithheld her while in woe
    she abased herself before him.\r\n\r\nHe spoke, and his voice came clogged and
    painful as though it urged from\r\nthe matted pores of the earth itself.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
    is none left to whom you may go but me only. Do not be afraid,\r\nbut come to
    me and I will give you these wild delights which have been\r\nlong forgotten.
    All things which are crude and riotous, all that is\r\ngross and without limit
    is mine. You shall not think and suffer any\r\nlonger; but you shall feel so
    surely that the heat of the sun will be\r\nhappiness: the taste of food, the
    wind that blows upon you, the ripe\r\nease of your body--these things will amaze
    you who have forgotten them.\r\nMy great arms about you will make you furious
    and young again; you shall\r\nleap on the hillside like a young goat and sing
    for joy as the birds\r\nsing. Leave this crabbed humanity that is barred and
    chained away\r\nfrom joy and come with me, to whose ancient quietude at the last
    both\r\nStrength and Beauty will come like children tired in the evening,\r\nreturning
    to the freedom of the brutes and the birds, with bodies\r\nsufficient for their
    pleasure and with no care for Thought or foolish\r\ncuriosity.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut
    the Thin Woman drew back from his hand, saying \u201CIt is not lawful to\r\nturn
    again when the journey is commenced, but to go forward to whatever\r\nis appointed;
    nor may we return to your meadows and trees and sunny\r\nplaces who have once
    departed from them. The torments of the mind may\r\nnot be renounced for any
    easement of the body until the smoke that\r\nblinds us is blown away, and the
    tormenting flame has fitted us for that\r\nimmortal ecstasy which is the bosom
    of God. Nor is it lawful that ye\r\ngreat ones should beset the path of travellers,
    seeking to lure them\r\naway with cunning promises. It is only at the cross-roads
    ye may sit\r\nwhere the traveller will hesitate and be in doubt, but on the highway
    ye\r\nhave no power.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are free of me,\u201D said the third
    man, \u201Cuntil you are ready to come\r\nto me again, for I only of all things
    am steadfast and patient, and\r\nto me all return in their seasons. There are
    brightnesses in my secret\r\nplaces in the woods, and lamps in my gardens beneath
    the hills, tended\r\nby the angels of God, and behind my face there is another
    face not hated\r\nby the Bright Ones.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the three Absolutes arose
    and strode mightily away; and as they went\r\ntheir thunderous speech to each
    other boomed against the clouds and the\r\nearth like a gusty wind, and, even
    when they had disappeared, that great\r\nrumble could be heard dying gently away
    in the moonlit distances.\r\n\r\nThe Thin Woman and the children went slowly
    forward on the rugged,\r\nsloping way. Far beyond, near the distant summit of
    the hill there was a\r\nlight gleaming.\r\n\r\n\u201CYonder,\u201D said the Thin
    Woman, \u201Cis the Brugh of Angus Mac an Og, the\r\nson of the Dagda Mor,\u201D
    and toward this light she assisted the weary\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIn a little
    she was in the presence of the god and by him refreshed\r\nand comforted. She
    told him all that had happened to her husband and\r\nimplored his assistance.
    This was readily accorded, for the chief\r\nbusiness of the gods is to give protection
    and assistance to such of\r\ntheir people as require it; but (and this is their
    limitation) they\r\ncannot give any help until it is demanded, the freewill of
    mankind being\r\nthe most jealously guarded and holy principle in life; therefore,
    the\r\ninterference of the loving gods comes only on an equally loving summons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER
    XVIII\r\n\r\nCAITILIN NI MURRACHU sat alone in the Brugh of Angus much as she
    had sat\r\non the hillside and in the cave of Pan, and again she was thinking.
    She\r\nwas happy now. There was nothing more she could desire, for all that the\r\nearth
    contained or the mind could describe was hers. Her thoughts were\r\nno longer
    those shy, subterranean gropings which elude the hand and the\r\nunderstanding.
    Each thought was a thing or a person, visible in its own\r\nradiant personal
    life, and to be seen or felt, welcomed or repulsed, as\r\nwas its due. But she
    had discovered that happiness is not laughter or\r\nsatisfaction, and that no
    person can be happy for themselves alone. So\r\nshe had come to understand the
    terrible sadness of the gods, and why\r\nAngus wept in secret; for often in the
    night she had heard him weeping,\r\nand she knew that his tears were for those
    others who were unhappy, and\r\nthat he could not be comforted while there was
    a woeful person or\r\nan evil deed hiding in the world. Her own happiness also
    had become\r\ninfected with this alien misery, until she knew that nothing was
    alien\r\nto her, and that in truth all persons and all things were her brothers\r\nand
    sisters and that they were living and dying in distress; and at\r\nthe last she
    knew that there was not any man but mankind, nor any human\r\nbeing but only
    humanity. Never again could the gratification of a desire\r\ngive her pleasure
    for her sense of oneness was destroyed--she was not an\r\nindividual only; she
    was also part of a mighty organism ordained, through\r\nwhatever stress, to achieve
    its oneness, and this great being was\r\nthreefold, comprising in its mighty
    units God and Man and Nature--the\r\nimmortal trinity. The duty of life is the
    sacrifice of self: it is to\r\nrenounce the little ego that the mighty ego may
    be freed; and, knowing\r\nthis, she found at last that she knew Happiness, that
    divine discontent\r\nwhich cannot rest nor be at ease until its bourne is attained
    and the\r\nknowledge of a man is added to the gaiety of a child. Angus had told
    her\r\nthat beyond this there lay the great ecstasy which is Love and God and\r\nthe
    beginning and the end of all things; for everything must come from\r\nthe Liberty
    into the Bondage, that it may return again to the Liberty\r\ncomprehending all
    things and fitted for that fiery enjoyment. This\r\ncannot be until there are
    no more fools living, for until the last fool\r\nhas grown wise wisdom will totter
    and freedom will still be invisible.\r\nGrowth is not by years but by multitudes,
    and until there is a common\r\neye no one person can see God, for the eye of
    all nature will scarcely\r\nbe great enough to look upon that majesty. We shall
    greet Happiness by\r\nmultitudes, but we can only greet Him by starry systems
    and a universal\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nShe was so thinking when Angus Og came to her
    from the fields. The god\r\nwas very radiant, smiling like the young morn when
    the buds awake, and\r\nto his lips song came instead of speech.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    beloved,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe will go on a journey today.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    delight is where you go,\u201D said Caitilin.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe will go down to
    the world of men--from our quiet dwelling among the\r\nhills to the noisy city
    and the multitude of people. This will be our\r\nfirst journey, but on a time
    not distant we will go to them again, and\r\nwe will not return from that journey,
    for we will live among our people\r\nand be at peace.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMay
    the day come soon,\u201D said she.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen thy son is a man he will
    go before us on that journey,\u201D said\r\nAngus, and Caitilin shivered with
    a great delight, knowing that a son\r\nwould be born to her.\r\n\r\nThen Angus
    Og put upon his bride glorious raiment, and they went out to\r\nthe sunlight.
    It was the early morning, the sun had just risen and the\r\ndew was sparkling
    on the heather and the grass. There was a keen stir\r\nin the air that stung
    the blood to joy, so that Caitilin danced in\r\nuncontrollable gaiety, and Angus,
    with a merry voice, chanted to the sky\r\nand danced also. About his shining
    head the birds were flying; for\r\nevery kiss he gave to Caitilin became a bird,
    the messengers of love and\r\nwisdom, and they also burst into triumphant melody,
    so that the quiet\r\nplace rang with their glee. Constantly from the circling
    birds one would\r\ngo flying with great speed to all quarters of space. These
    were his\r\nmessengers flying to every fort and dun, every rath and glen and
    valley\r\nof Eire to raise the Sluaige Shee (the Fairy Host). They were birds
    of\r\nlove that flew, for this was a hosting of happiness, and, therefore the\r\nShee
    would not bring weapons with them.\r\n\r\nIt was towards Kilmasheogue their happy
    steps were directed, and soon\r\nthey came to the mountain.\r\n\r\nAfter the
    Thin Woman of Inis Magrath had left the god she visited all\r\nthe fairy forts
    of Kilmasheogue, and directed the Shee who lived\r\nthere to be in waiting at
    the dawn on the summit of the mountain;\r\nconsequently, when Angus and Caitilin
    came up the hill, they found the\r\nsix clans coming to receive them, and with
    these were the people of the\r\nyounger Shee, members of the Tuatha da Danaan,
    tall and beautiful men\r\nand women who had descended to the quiet underworld
    when the pressure\r\nof the sons of Milith forced them with their kind enchantments
    and\r\ninvincible velour to the country of the gods.\r\n\r\nOf those who came
    were Aine Ni Rogail of Cnoc Aine and Ivil of Craglea,\r\nthe queens of North
    and South Munster, and Una the queen of Ormond;\r\nthese, with their hosts, sang
    upon the summit of the hill welcoming\r\nthe god. There came the five guardians
    of Ulster, the fomentors of\r\ncombat:--Brier Mac Belgan of Dromona Breg, Redg
    Rotbill from the slopes\r\nof Magh-Itar, Tinnel the son of Boclacthna of Slieve
    Edlicon, Grici of\r\nCruachan-Aigle, a goodly name, and Gulban Glas Mac Grici,
    whose dun is\r\nin the Ben of Gulban. These five, matchless in combat, marched
    up the\r\nhill with their tribes, shouting as they went. From north and south\r\nthey
    came, and from east and west, bright and happy beings, a multitude,\r\nwithout
    fear, without distraction, so that soon the hill was gay with\r\ntheir voices
    and their noble raiment.\r\n\r\nAmong them came the people of the Lupra, the
    ancient Leprecauns of\r\nthe world, leaping like goats among the knees of the
    heroes. They were\r\nheaded by their king Udan Mac Audain and Beg Mac Beg his
    tanist, and,\r\nfollowing behind, was Glomhar O\u2019Glomrach of the sea, the
    strongest man\r\nof their people, dressed in the skin of a weasel; and there
    were also\r\nthe chief men of that clan, well known of old, Conan Mac Rihid,
    Gaerku\r\nMac Gairid, Mether Mac Mintan and Esirt Mac Beg, the son of Bueyen,
    born\r\nin a victory. This king was that same Udan the chief of the Lupra who\r\nhad
    been placed under bonds to taste the porridge in the great cauldron\r\nof Emania,
    into which pot he fell, and was taken captive with his wife,\r\nand held for
    five weary years, until he surrendered that which he most\r\nvalued in the world,
    even his boots: the people of the hills laugh still\r\nat the story, and the
    Leprecauns may still be mortified by it.\r\n\r\nThere came Bove Derg, the Fiery,
    seldom seen, and his harper the son of\r\nTrogain, whose music heals the sick
    and makes the sad heart merry; Rochy\r\nMac Elathan, Dagda Mor, the Father of
    Stars, and his daughter from the\r\nCave of Cruachan; Credh Mac Aedh of Raghery
    and Cas Corach son of the\r\ngreat Ollav; Mananaan Mac Lir came from his wide
    waters shouting louder\r\nthan the wind, with his daughters Cliona and Aoife
    and Etain Fair-Hair;\r\nand Coll and Cecht and Mac Greina, the Plough, the Hazel,
    and the Sun\r\ncame with their wives, whose names are not forgotten, even Banba
    and\r\nFodla and Eire, names of glory. Lugh of the Long-Hand, filled with\r\nmysterious
    wisdom, was not absent, whose father was sadly avenged on the\r\nsons of Turann--these
    with their hosts.\r\n\r\nAnd one came also to whom the hosts shouted with mighty
    love, even the\r\nSerene One, Dana, the Mother of the gods, steadfast for ever.
    Her breath\r\nis on the morning, her smile is summer. From her hand the birds
    of the\r\nair take their food. The mild ox is her friend, and the wolf trots
    by\r\nher friendly side; at her voice the daisy peeps from her cave and\r\nthe
    nettle couches his lance. The rose arrays herself in innocence,\r\nscattering
    abroad her sweetness with the dew, and the oak tree laughs\r\nto her in the air.
    Thou beautiful! the lambs follow thy footsteps, they\r\ncrop thy bounty in the
    meadows and are not thwarted: the weary men cling\r\nto thy bosom everlasting.
    Through thee all actions and the deeds of\r\nmen, through thee all voices come
    to us, even the Divine Promise and the\r\nbreath of the Almighty from afar laden
    with goodness.\r\n\r\nWith wonder, with delight, the daughter of Murrachu watched
    the hosting\r\nof the Shee. Sometimes her eyes were dazzled as a jewelled forehead\r\nblazed
    in the sun, or a shoulder-torque of broad gold flamed like a\r\ntorch. On fair
    hair and dark the sun gleamed: white arms tossed and\r\nglanced a moment and
    sank and reappeared. The eyes of those who did\r\nnot hesitate nor compute looked
    into her eyes, not appraising, not\r\nquestioning, but mild and unafraid. The
    voices of free people spoke in\r\nher ears and the laughter of happy hearts,
    unthoughtful of sin or shame,\r\nreleased from the hard bondage of selfhood.
    For these people, though\r\nmany, were one. Each spoke to the other as to himself,
    without\r\nreservation or subterfuge. They moved freely each in his personal
    whim,\r\nand they moved also with the unity of one being: for when they shouted\r\nto
    the Mother of the gods they shouted with one voice, and they bowed\r\nto her
    as one man bows. Through the many minds there went also one mind,\r\ncorrecting,
    commanding, so that in a moment the interchangeable and\r\nfluid became locked,
    and organic with a simultaneous understanding, a\r\ncollective action-which was
    freedom.\r\n\r\nWhile she looked the dancing ceased, and they turned their faces
    with\r\none accord down the mountain. Those in the front leaped forward, and\r\nbehind
    them the others went leaping in orderly progression.\r\n\r\nThen Angus Og ran
    to where she stood, his bride of Beauty \u201CCome,\r\nmy beloved,\u201D said
    he, and hand in hand they raced among the others,\r\nlaughing as they ran.\r\n\r\nHere
    there was no green thing growing; a carpet of brown turf spread\r\nto the edge
    of sight on the sloping plain and away to where another\r\nmountain soared in
    the air. They came to this and descended. In the\r\ndistance, groves of trees
    could be seen, and, very far away, the roofs\r\nand towers and spires of the
    Town of the Ford of Hurdles, and the\r\nlittle roads that wandered everywhere;
    but on this height there was only\r\nprickly furze growing softly in the sunlight;
    the bee droned his loud\r\nsong, the birds flew and sang occasionally, and the
    little streams grew\r\nheavy with their falling waters. A little further and
    the bushes were\r\ngreen and beautiful, waving their gentle leaves in the quietude,
    and\r\nbeyond again, wrapped in sunshine and peace, the trees looked on the\r\nworld
    from their calm heights, having no complaint to make of anything.\r\n\r\nIn a
    little they reached the grass land and the dance began. Hand sought\r\nfor hand,
    feet moved companionably as though they loved each other;\r\nquietly intimate
    they tripped without faltering, and, then, the loud\r\nsong arose--they sang
    to the lovers of gaiety and peace, long defrauded\r\n\u201CCome to us, ye who
    do not know where ye are--ye who live among\r\nstrangers in the house of dismay
    and self-righteousness. Poor, awkward\r\nones! How bewildered and bedevilled
    ye go! Amazed ye look and do not\r\ncomprehend, for your eyes are set upon a
    star and your feet move in the\r\nblessed kingdoms of the Shee Innocents! in
    what prisons are ye flung? To\r\nwhat lowliness are ye bowed? How are ye ground
    between the laws and the\r\ncustoms? The dark people of the Fomor have ye in
    thrall; and upon your\r\nminds they have fastened a band of lead, your hearts
    are hung with iron,\r\nand about your loins a cincture of brass impressed, woeful!
    Believe it,\r\nthat the sun does shine, the flowers grow, and the birds sing
    pleasantly\r\nin the trees. The free winds are everywhere, the water tumbles
    on the\r\nhills, the eagle calls aloud through the solitude, and his mate comes\r\nspeedily.
    The bees are gathering honey in the sunlight, the midges dance\r\ntogether, and
    the great bull bellows across the river. The crow says a\r\nword to his brethren,
    and the wren snuggles her young in the hedge....\r\nCome to us, ye lovers of
    life and happiness. Hold out thy hand--a\r\nbrother shall seize it from afar.
    Leave the plough and the cart for a\r\nlittle time: put aside the needle and
    the awl--Is leather thy brother, O\r\nman?... Come away! come away! from the
    loom and the desk, from the shop\r\nwhere the carcasses are hung, from the place
    where raiment is sold and\r\nthe place where it is sewn in darkness: O bad treachery!
    Is it for joy\r\nyou sit in the broker\u2019s den, thou pale man? Has the attorney
    enchanted\r\nthee?... Come away! for the dance has begun lightly, the wind is\r\nsounding
    over the hill, the sun laughs down into the valley, and the sea\r\nleaps upon
    the shingle, panting for joy, dancing, dancing, dancing for\r\njoy....\u201D\r\n\r\nThey
    swept through the goat tracks and the little boreens and the\r\ncurving roads.
    Down to the city they went dancing and singing; among\r\nthe streets and the
    shops telling their sunny tale; not heeding the\r\nmalignant eyes and the cold
    brows as the sons of Balor looked sidewards.\r\nAnd they took the Philosopher
    from his prison, even the Intellect of\r\nMan they took from the hands of the
    doctors and lawyers, from the sly\r\npriests, from the professors whose mouths
    are gorged with sawdust, and\r\nthe merchants who sell blades of grass--the awful
    people of the Fomor...\r\nand then they returned again, dancing and singing,
    to the country of the\r\ngods....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project

    Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works
    in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete,
    old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds
    of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers
    and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need,
    are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that
    the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations
    to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created
    to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
    generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand
    how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation

    Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends
    upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to
    carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed
    works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by
    the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1
    to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with
    the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities
    and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance
    requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork
    and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit
    donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of
    compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular
    state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions
    from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of
    no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such
    states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations
    are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax
    treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws
    alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages
    for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number
    of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo
    donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General
    Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor
    Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a
    library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For
    thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with
    only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks
    are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed
    as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus,
    we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
    edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
    facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes
    information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to
    the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our
    new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new
    eBooks.\r\n"
